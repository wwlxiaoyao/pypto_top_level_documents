# PyPTO Training: Architecture Design Enhancement

This document describes the architecture design enhancements required to add **training capability** (forward + backward + gradient computation) to the PyPTO language and framework. Today PyPTO supports **inference only** — the *forward* computation of an AI model, decomposed into InCore functions that are submitted by orchestrator functions and whose intermediate memory is managed by the `simpler` runtime (allocated at InCore submission, released when the tensor's life cycle completes).

The design is presented **step by step**. Each part is self-contained and builds on the previous one.

| Part | Topic | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **Part 1** | **DSL enhancement: differentiable functions, saved context, backward declaration, dynamic backward graph** | this document |
| **Part 2** | **Memory management for training: saved-context lifetime, forward/backward ring schemes, heap separation** | **this document (current step)** |
| **Part 3** | **Backward runtime/scheduler, gradient accumulation, persistent region, optimizer step** | **this document (current step)** |
| **Part 4** | **Distributed training (data / tensor / pipeline / expert parallel), ZeRO, recompute at scale** | **this document (current step)** |

Reference background on the PyTorch autograd mechanism that motivates this design is in [`PyTorch_Forward Tensor Retention and Memory.md`](PyTorch_Forward%20Tensor%20Retention%20and%20Memory.md). Framework background is in [`machine_hierarchy_and_function_hierarchy.md`](machine_hierarchy_and_function_hierarchy.md) and [`multi_level_runtime_ring_and_pypto_free_api.md`](multi_level_runtime_ring_and_pypto_free_api.md).

# Part 1 — Domain Specific Language Enhancement

## 1. Background and the Core Question

### 1.1 What PyPTO has today (inference / forward only)

- A model is divided into **InCore functions** (Linqu Level 0, a single core / core-group). Each InCore function is a **tile-sized chunk** of compute that fits AI core resource constraints (notably **SRAM / on-chip buffer size**).
- InCore functions are produced by the compiler from orchestrator-level tile algebra, either explicitly (`@pl.function(type=InCore)`) or by automatic outlining (`with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk])`), which performs chunked-loop splitting + interchange + `OutlineIncoreScopes`.
- An **orchestrator** function (Chip / Host level) runs a sequential program that **submits** InCore invocations. Dependencies are inferred automatically from a **tensormap** (producer/consumer), not from an explicit DAG.
- **Memory** for forward intermediates is managed by `simpler` as a **multi-layer ring stack** indexed by scope depth: a buffer is allocated at InCore submission and reclaimed when its life cycle ends — i.e. when the scope token has been applied (`scope.exit()` or `pl.free`) **and** `ref_count == fanout_count`. See `multi_level_runtime_ring_and_pypto_free_api.md`.

The essential property: **forward intermediates are short-lived.** Once all consumers in the current scope have run, the buffer is reclaimed and the ring head advances.

### 1.2 What training breaks

Training breaks the "short-lived" assumption in exactly the way described for PyTorch: **some forward data must survive the forward pass to be consumed later by the backward pass.** A buffer that the forward ring would normally reclaim at scope exit may be a *saved activation* that backward needs much later (potentially after the entire forward of all layers completes).

This forces four DSL-level questions, which this part answers:

1. **Saved context** — do we follow PyTorch's `ctx.save_for_backward()` model, and what new grammar describes *what* is saved for backward (§5)?
2. **Backward declaration** — how does a programmer describe the backward computation, and must every forward InCore function have a matching backward InCore function (§6, §7)?
3. **Dynamic backward graph** — do we build the backward graph dynamically as the forward executes, à la PyTorch define-by-run (§8)?
4. **Saved-context lifetime** — how does declaring "save for backward" change tensor lifetime, and how does that interact with the ring memory manager (§9, full scheme deferred to Part 2)?

---

## 2. Design Philosophy: Where Autograd Lives in the PyPTO Hierarchy

PyTorch's autograd records nodes at the granularity of **individual tensor operators** (`mul`, `relu`, `matmul`). PyPTO has a *different* natural granularity, and getting this right is the central design decision.

PyPTO has (at least) three candidate granularities for differentiation:

| Granularity | What it is | Suitability as autograd unit |
|-------------|------------|------------------------------|
| **Tile op** (`pl.matmul`, `pl.add`, `pl.row_sum`) inside an InCore | finest; the per-tile primitive | too fine: a tile op is one chunk of a chunked loop, not a logical math op |
| **InCore function** | one outlined kernel that fits SRAM | wrong unit: it is a *tiling artifact*, not a logical operation; its boundary is chosen for hardware fit, not for differentiation |
| **Differentiable function** (orchestrator-level logical op, e.g. one `matmul`, one `rms_norm`, one attention block) | the logical operation the programmer wrote, *before* chunking/outlining | **correct unit** — this is the PyPTO analog of `torch.autograd.Function` |

**Decision: autograd is defined at the *differentiable function* level — the logical operation written in orchestrator-level tile algebra — NOT at the InCore kernel level.**

The reason is that the InCore boundary is *not* a fused mega-kernel and is *not* a logical operation. It is the result of `auto_chunk` splitting a loop so each chunk fits SRAM. Differentiating at that boundary would (a) force the programmer to reason about tiling when writing gradients, and (b) wrongly couple the forward tiling to the backward tiling. We avoid both by differentiating one level up, where the math is expressed, and letting the **same compiler machinery** (`pl.at` + `auto_chunk` + `OutlineIncoreScopes`) independently outline the backward into its own InCore functions.

This is the single most important answer to the user's question — and it directly determines that **forward and backward InCore functions are not 1:1** (see §7).

---

## 3. The Unit of Differentiation: the Differentiable Function

A **differentiable function** is a logical operation with:

- a **forward** body, written in the existing orchestrator-level tile algebra (`pl.slice`, `pl.matmul`, `pl.assemble`, `pl.parallel`, …) inside a `with pl.at(...)` region;
- an optional **backward** body, written in the *same* tile algebra, that consumes upstream gradients and saved context and produces input gradients;
- a **context** object that carries tensors/metadata from forward to backward.

There are two ways a differentiable function gets its backward, mirroring PyTorch:

1. **Composite (auto-derived):** if the function is built only from other differentiable functions / differentiable primitives, the programmer writes **no** backward — the framework derives it by reversing the recorded tape (§8). This is the common case (a whole layer, an MLP, etc.).
2. **Custom (programmer-supplied):** for a leaf primitive, or to override the auto-derived gradient for performance (e.g. a fused, recompute-friendly backward), the programmer supplies an explicit backward (§6.2).

This is exactly the PyTorch split between "Python composition needs no backward" and "`torch.autograd.Function` must define backward" — see reference doc §"pytorch是否要求每一个forward算子都有与之匹配的backward算子".

---

## 4. DSL: Gradient-Tracked Tensors and Parameters

Training introduces **two orthogonal axes** on a tensor, which must not be conflated:

- **`requires_grad` — the *autograd* axis.** "Should the framework track this tensor in the backward graph and compute a gradient for it?" This is a property of *any* tensor (a weight, a tracked input, a propagated intermediate).
- **`pl.parameter` — the *storage / optimization* axis.** "Is this a persistent, learnable leaf that the optimizer updates?" This places the tensor in the persistent region and registers it with the optimizer.

```python
# (a) requires_grad: a tensor that participates in gradient computation
w = pl.Tensor[[k, n], pl.FP32](requires_grad=True)

# (b) pl.parameter: a persistent learnable weight declared at program level
@pl.program
class MyModel:
    @pl.parameter                      # persistent learnable leaf; see semantics below
    def w_qkv(self) -> pl.Tensor[[d, 3 * d], pl.BF16]:
        return pl.init.normal(std=0.02)        # initializer runs once, at allocation

    @pl.parameter(requires_grad=False)  # a FROZEN parameter (persistent, but not trained)
    def rotary_cache(self) -> pl.Tensor[[S, d], pl.FP32]:
        return pl.init.rope_table(...)
```

### 4.1 Semantics of `requires_grad` (autograd axis)

Mirrors PyTorch, adapted to PyPTO's define-by-run orchestration:

- A tensor produced by a differentiable function is gradient-tracked iff **any** input is gradient-tracked (the `requires_grad` propagation rule). This is how intermediate activations *become* tracked without being declared.
- Under an inference region — `with pl.no_grad():` — no context is saved and no tape is recorded; this is the training/inference switch and is the analog of `torch.no_grad()`. The existing forward-only pipeline is exactly the `pl.no_grad()` behavior, so **inference is unchanged and is the zero-cost default for non-training programs**.
- Each gradient-tracked tensor `t` has an associated gradient buffer `t.grad` with the **same shape/dtype**. For non-parameter (activation) tensors this buffer is **transient** and lazily allocated by the backward pass (§25.1); for parameters it is **persistent** (§25.2, §4.2).

### 4.2 Semantics of `pl.parameter` (storage / optimization axis)

`@pl.parameter` is a **new** DSL construct (PyPTO's analog of `torch.nn.Parameter`). It declares a tensor whose role is "a learnable weight of the model," and that role implies a bundle of guarantees the plain `requires_grad` flag does **not**:

1. **Persistent residency (Part 3 §26).** The tensor lives in the **persistent region** for the entire training run — allocated once by the `PersistentAllocator`, never ring/stack-managed. (A plain `requires_grad=True` activation lives in the transient arena and is reclaimed every micro-batch.)
2. **Optimizer registration.** It is enrolled in `model.parameters()`, so the optimizer (§27) sees it and updates it in place at `opt.step()`. A `requires_grad=True` tensor that is *not* a parameter is differentiated but **not** optimized.
3. **Companion-buffer allocation.** The runtime allocates its **persistent gradient** `w.grad` (the `atomic_add` accumulation target, §25.2) and its **optimizer state** (e.g. AdamW `m, v`, §26) — hence the ≈4×-parameter-bytes persistent footprint.
4. **Autograd leaf.** It is always a **leaf** of the backward graph (a gradient *sink* / `AccumulateGrad`-style node), never an intermediate produced by a differentiable function.
5. **Default `requires_grad=True`, but toggleable.** A parameter is trained by default; `@pl.parameter(requires_grad=False)` declares a **frozen** parameter — still persistent and part of the model, but no gradient is computed and the optimizer skips it (LoRA base weights, frozen embeddings, RoPE caches, etc.).
6. **One-time initialization.** The body provides an initializer that runs once at allocation, not per step.

### 4.3 Is `requires_grad=True` redundant with `pl.parameter`? — No

They are **not** the same thing and **not** redundant; they answer different questions and intersect rather than coincide:

| Tensor kind | `pl.parameter`? | `requires_grad`? | Storage | Optimized? | Gradient computed? |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|---------|------------|--------------------|
| Trainable weight | ✅ | ✅ (default) | persistent | ✅ | ✅ → `w.grad` (persistent) |
| **Frozen** weight | ✅ | ❌ (`requires_grad=False`) | persistent | ❌ | ❌ |
| Tracked **input** (e.g. for input-grad / adversarial) | ❌ | ✅ | transient/external | ❌ | ✅ → `x.grad` (transient) |
| **Activation** (propagated) | ❌ | ✅ (inherited) | transient | ❌ | ✅ (consumed, then reclaimed) |
| Plain inference tensor | ❌ | ❌ | transient | ❌ | ❌ |

So the precise relationship is **containment, not equality**:

> `pl.parameter` **implies** `requires_grad=True` *by default* (a parameter is normally trained), but it adds **persistence + optimizer registration + companion grad/state allocation** on top. Conversely, many `requires_grad=True` tensors are **not** parameters (tracked inputs, propagated activations). And the two axes genuinely separate in the **frozen-parameter** case: `pl.parameter(requires_grad=False)` — a parameter (persistent, part of the model) that is *not* gradient-tracked.

In one line: **`requires_grad` decides *whether a gradient flows*; `pl.parameter` decides *whether the tensor is a persistent, optimizer-owned weight*.** A parameter sets `requires_grad`'s default, but the flag remains an independent, meaningful toggle on it (train vs freeze).

---

## 5. DSL: Saved Context (`pl.save_for_backward`)

We **do** follow the PyTorch `ctx.save_for_backward()` model, because it gives the framework the one thing the ring allocator needs: an explicit, programmer-declared set of tensors whose lifetime must extend past forward scope exit into the backward pass. Without such a declaration the runtime cannot tell a normal (reclaimable) activation from a saved (must-survive) activation.

### 5.1 Grammar

A context object `ctx` is available inside a custom differentiable function. Two declaration channels, matching PyTorch's tensor vs non-tensor split:

```python
@pl.autograd_function
class FusedMatMul:
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, a, b):                 # tile-algebra, like today's forward
        c = pl.matmul(a, b)
        ctx.save_for_backward(a, b)         # TENSORS that backward needs
        ctx.meta(transpose_b=False)         # non-tensor metadata (shape, flags, axes)
        return c

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, grad_c):              # tile-algebra, like a forward body
        a, b = ctx.saved_tensors
        grad_a = pl.matmul(grad_c, pl.transpose(b))
        grad_b = pl.matmul(pl.transpose(a), grad_c)
        return grad_a, grad_b
```

- `ctx.save_for_backward(*tensors)` — declares tensors that must survive into backward. This is the **only** way to keep a forward tensor alive for backward; it is *not* allowed to capture a forward tensor via a Python closure (same rule and same reasoning as PyTorch — see reference doc §3 "为什么要区分").
- `ctx.meta(**kwargs)` — non-tensor metadata (shapes, scalars, axis ids, flags). Carries no buffer cost.

### 5.2 The saved-for-backward attribute is the lifetime hook

`save_for_backward(t)` is **copy-free at the DSL level** — it does not *logically* duplicate `t`. What it does is promote `t` to a distinct **lifetime class — `SAVED`** — telling the memory manager that this datum (a) **must not be reclaimed at forward scope exit** like an ordinary activation, and (b) is reclaimed **only after its backward consumer runs**.

Because a `SAVED` tensor outlives its forward scope, it **cannot occupy a slot in the forward ring** (the ring requires contiguous allocate/free with a monotone head; an un-reclaimable buffer in the middle would stall head advance and inflate peak memory). Therefore a `SAVED` tensor lives in a **separate region** — a dedicated **LIFO stack**, *not* the ring. The runtime realizes "copy-free" by **allocating the producer's output directly in that SAVED stack** at submission time (no ring slot, no copy); a physical copy is only a **fallback** for views / retroactive saves, and persistent inputs are merely referenced. This is the DSL-visible seam into the memory design; the full scheme — separate region, why a stack (not a heap), allocate-in-place vs copy-fallback, and ring isolation — is specified in **Part 2 §13 and §15.3**.

### 5.3 Save *output*, not *input*, when cheaper (programmer's choice)

As in PyTorch, the programmer chooses *what* to save to minimize memory. Examples that should be encoded as guidance / lints:

- `relu`/activation: save a **mask** (or the output), not the input.
- `sigmoid`/`tanh`: save the **output** (derivative is a function of output).
- `add`: save **nothing** (gradient passes through).
- reductions (`sum`/`mean`/`row_sum`): save only **shape** via `ctx.meta`, no tensor.

This is the principal lever on activation memory, identical in spirit to PyTorch's `derivatives.yaml` selectivity.

## 6. DSL: Declaring Backward

### 6.1 Composite functions — no backward written

A function composed of differentiable sub-functions needs no backward. The tape (§8) records the sub-calls and reverses them automatically.

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Opaque, differentiable=True)
def mlp(self, x, w1, w2):
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk]):
        h = relu(matmul(x, w1))    # relu, matmul are differentiable functions
        y = matmul(h, w2)
    return y
# No backward: framework reverses matmul→relu→matmul automatically.
```

### 6.2 Custom functions — backward written in tile algebra

For primitives or performance overrides, supply `backward` as in §5.1. The crucial point:

> The backward body is written at the **same abstraction level as forward** — orchestrator-level tile algebra inside `pl.at(...)`. The programmer does **not** write an "InCore backward kernel." The compiler outlines the backward body into backward InCore functions using the **same** `auto_chunk` machinery, tiled to backward's *own* SRAM constraints.

### 6.3 Recompute / checkpoint as a first-class option (`pl.checkpoint`)

Because backward is just another tile-algebra body, gradient checkpointing is expressible directly: a region can save *nothing internal* and **recompute** its forward during backward (trading compute for memory). We expose this declaratively:

```python
with pl.checkpoint():        # save no INTERNAL activations; recompute them in backward
    h = expensive_block(x)
```

This is the PyPTO analog of `torch.utils.checkpoint` and of the min-cut rematerialization partitioner (reference doc Part 1 §4).

#### 6.3.1 What `pl.checkpoint()` does

`pl.checkpoint()` turns its wrapped region into **one checkpointed differentiable function** with a special save/backward contract:

1. **Save only the boundary inputs, not the internals.** Normally each differentiable function inside the region would `save_for_backward` its own activations (Linear saves its input, FlashAttention saves `q,k,v,o,lse`, …), and all of those would enter the `SAVED` region. Under `pl.checkpoint()`, those internal saves are **suppressed**: the region saves only the tensors needed to *re-derive* everything — its **inputs** (here `x`) plus enough metadata (e.g. RNG state, §6.3.4) — and nothing else.
2. **Single outer tape node.** The region becomes **one** `GradNode` on the outer tape (§8), whose `saved_ctx = {region inputs, rng_state}` and whose `backward_fn` is "**recompute the region forward, then backward through it**."
3. **Recompute-then-backward in `backward`.** When `loss.backward()` reaches this node, it (a) **re-runs the region's forward** from the saved inputs, under grad tracking, rebuilding all internal activations and a *nested* tape; (b) walks that nested tape in reverse to produce the input gradients (and accumulate parameter grads); (c) frees the recomputed internals immediately.

#### 6.3.2 A more complete example

Take one transformer block (attention + SwiGLU MLP). **Without** checkpointing, every internal activation that some backward needs is promoted to `SAVED`:

```python
@pl.function(differentiable=True)
def block(self, x, w):
    h1 = RMSNorm.apply(x, w.norm1)        # saves x, rstd1
    a  = attention(h1, w)                 # FlashAttention saves q',k',v,o,lse (§10.2)
    x1 = Add.apply(x, a)
    h2 = RMSNorm.apply(x1, w.norm2)       # saves x1, rstd2
    s  = swiglu_mlp(h2, w)                # SwiGLU saves g,u ; Linears save h2, s
    return Add.apply(x1, s)
# SAVED footprint per block ≈ { x, rstd1, q',k',v,o,lse, x1, rstd2, h2, g, u, s }  ← large
```

**With** `pl.checkpoint()` the identical math runs, but the internal saves are dropped:

```python
@pl.function(differentiable=True)
def block_ckpt(self, x, w):
    with pl.checkpoint():
        h1 = RMSNorm.apply(x, w.norm1)
        a  = attention(h1, w)
        x1 = Add.apply(x, a)
        h2 = RMSNorm.apply(x1, w.norm2)
        s  = swiglu_mlp(h2, w)
        y  = Add.apply(x1, s)
    return y
# SAVED footprint per block ≈ { x, rng_state }   ← only the boundary input + meta
```

`w.*` are persistent parameters (referenced, never saved, §13.3), so the only `SAVED` cost of the checkpointed block is its input `x` (and a few bytes of RNG state).

**The backward is implicit.** `pl.checkpoint()` does *not* write any backward into the source, and it does *not* run the backward at the end of the `with` block. At scope exit it only **registers one outer-tape `GradNode`**; the generated backward (`_ckpt_backward`) **executes later**, when `loss.backward()` walks the tape in reverse and reaches this node (§8). The listing below shows, **as comments**, the implicit work the compiler/runtime inserts at each point — what happens at `with` enter/exit during forward, and the backward body that runs at `backward()` time:

```python
@pl.function(differentiable=True)
def block_ckpt(self, x, w):
    # ── pl.checkpoint() ENTER (forward) ──────────────────────────────────────
    #   implicit: ckpt_inputs = {x}                  # boundary tensors to re-derive from
    #   implicit: ckpt_rng    = capture_rng_state()  # for deterministic recompute (§6.3.4)
    #   implicit: enter NO-SAVE mode → suppress every save_for_backward in this region
    with pl.checkpoint():
        h1 = RMSNorm.apply(x, w.norm1)   # runs; its internal save_for_backward is SUPPRESSED
        a  = attention(h1, w)            # FlashAttention's save of q',k',v,o,lse is SUPPRESSED
        x1 = Add.apply(x, a)
        h2 = RMSNorm.apply(x1, w.norm2)
        s  = swiglu_mlp(h2, w)
        y  = Add.apply(x1, s)
    # ── pl.checkpoint() EXIT (forward) ───────────────────────────────────────
    #   implicit: internals (h1,a,x1,h2,s, q',k',v,o,lse,g,u,…) are TRANSIENT_FWD →
    #             RECLAIMED by the ring HERE at scope exit, NOT saved   (Part 2 §14)
    #   implicit: push ONLY {x} to the SAVED stack; keep ckpt_rng as meta   (§6.3.1)
    #   implicit: append ONE outer-tape GradNode:
    #               GradNode(backward_fn = _ckpt_backward,
    #                        saved_ctx   = {x, ckpt_rng},
    #                        in_edges    = [grad_fn(x)],         # where dx is sent (§8.3.1)
    #                        out_edge cnt = #consumers of y)     # where dy arrives from
    return y


# ===========================================================================

#         a  = attention(h1, w)
#         x1 = Add.apply(x, a)
#         h2 = RMSNorm.apply(x1, w.norm2)

#
#     # (2) NESTED BACKWARD: walk the inner tape in reverse (§8.4); each .bwd

#     dh2       = swiglu_mlp.backward(ds)         #  → atomic_add(w.gate/up/down.grad)
#     dx1_a     = RMSNorm.backward(dh2)           #  → atomic_add(w.norm2.grad)
#     dx1       = dx1_a + dx1_b                    # residual fan-in accumulation (§25.1)
#     dx_a, da  = Add.backward(dx1)               # residual 1
#     dh1       = attention.backward(da)          #  → atomic_add(attention weight grads)
#     dx_b      = RMSNorm.backward(dh1)           #  → atomic_add(w.norm1.grad)
#     dx        = dx_a + dx_b                       # input fan-in accumulation
#
#     # (3) FREE recomputed internals + inner SAVED sub-stack; pop x from SAVED.
#     return dx                                    # routed along in_edges → grad_fn(x)
```

So the only thing the programmer writes is `with pl.checkpoint():`; everything commented above — the input/RNG capture and save-suppression at *enter*, the reclaim + single-`GradNode` registration at *exit*, and the entire recompute-then-backward `_ckpt_backward` at *backward time* — is inserted implicitly.

#### 6.3.3 Effect on forward and backward (step by step)

**Forward (`block_ckpt`):**
- Runs exactly the same kernels and produces the same `y`.
- The internal tensors (`h1, q',k',v,o,lse, x1, h2, g, u, s`) are **never promoted to `SAVED`**; they remain ordinary `TRANSIENT_FWD` activations and are **reclaimed at the checkpoint region's scope exit**, exactly as in inference (Part 2 §14). Only `x` (+ RNG state) is pushed to the `SAVED` stack.
- The outer tape gets **one** node for the whole region.

**Backward (reaching the checkpoint node):**
1. **Recompute forward** of the region from `x` (under grad tracking): this re-creates `h1 … y` as fresh `TRANSIENT_BWD` activations and builds a **nested tape** (and a short-lived inner `SAVED` sub-stack for that recompute).
2. **Nested backward**: walk the nested tape in reverse — the normal `RMSNorm.bwd`, `FlashAttention.bwd`, `SwiGLU.bwd`, `Linear.bwd`, `Add.bwd` — producing `dx` and `atomic_add`-ing the parameter grads (`w.*.grad`).
3. **Free** the recomputed internals and the inner sub-stack; pop `x` from the outer `SAVED` stack.

So the checkpoint node performs **one extra forward of the region** during backward, in exchange for not having stored any of its internals.

#### 6.3.4 Determinism requirement (RNG / dropout)

Recompute must reproduce the *same* activations, so any **nondeterministic** op in the region (e.g. dropout) must replay identically. `pl.checkpoint()` therefore **captures the RNG state** at forward entry into `ctx.meta` and **restores it** before recompute, so the dropout mask is regenerated bit-for-bit. (In-place ops that overwrite inputs needed for recompute are disallowed inside a checkpoint region — same constraint as PyTorch.)

#### 6.3.5 Memory vs compute tradeoff, and the arena effect

| | Without `pl.checkpoint` | With `pl.checkpoint` |
|---|---|---|
| `SAVED` per block | all internals (`q',k',v,o,lse,h1,x1,h2,g,u,s,…`) | just `{x, rng_state}` |
| Forward compute | 1× | 1× |
| Backward compute | 1× | **≈2×** (recompute + backward) |
| Transient (bwd) churn | one bwd node | recompute working set + bwd |

For an `N`-layer model the `SAVED` peak (the dominant training-memory term, Part 2 §19) drops from `N × (all internals)` to `N × (one input) + 1 × (one block's internals during its recompute)`. This is the single biggest activation-memory lever. In the double-ended arena (Part 2 §15, §18), converting a function to checkpointed simply shifts the arena balance from `SAVED` toward `TRANSIENT` (the recompute lives in the transient region as `SAVED` drains), with no re-partitioning.

#### 6.3.6 Granularity and automation

- **Selective checkpointing:** wrap only the expensive sub-regions (e.g. attention) and let cheaper ones save normally — `pl.checkpoint()` composes at any granularity, including nesting.
- **Manual now, automatic later:** for Part 1 the decision is programmer-controlled. The AOT path (§8.7) can make it automatic via a **min-cut rematerialization** partitioner that chooses the save-vs-recompute cut to minimize the `SAVED` peak under a compute budget — i.e. it decides the contents of the `SAVED` stack for you.

## 7. Forward InCore vs Backward InCore: NOT One-to-One

This section answers the user's question directly.

### 7.1 Recommendation

**Do not require a 1:1 match between forward and backward InCore functions.** Match at the **differentiable-function** level only. Let the compiler outline forward and backward **independently**, each tiled to its own resource constraints.

### 7.2 Why 1:1 at the InCore level is wrong

1. **Different math, different shapes, different tiling.** For `C = A @ B`, backward is two *different* matmuls: `dA = dC @ Bᵀ` and `dB = Aᵀ @ dC`. Their tile shapes, K-dimension, and SRAM footprints differ from the forward matmul. Forcing the same chunking would be suboptimal or infeasible.
2. **Fan-out asymmetry.** One forward function with N inputs may need up to N gradient outputs, each potentially its own InCore family. One forward InCore can map to *several* backward InCores.
3. **Fan-in asymmetry.** Conversely, several forward InCores (e.g. an accumulation loop) can share a single backward formulation.
4. **SRAM constraints are per-direction.** The whole reason InCore boundaries exist is on-chip buffer fit. Backward has its own working set (it additionally holds `grad`, may hold saved activations); its optimal chunk size is generally *not* the forward chunk size. Tying them defeats the purpose.
5. **Separation of concerns.** Differentiation is a logical/mathematical transform; tiling is a hardware-fit transform. Coupling them forces the programmer to think about SRAM while writing gradients.

### 7.3 The resulting compiler flow

```
Differentiable function (forward body, tile algebra)
        │  auto_chunk + OutlineIncoreScopes          → forward InCore functions  (1..N_f)
        │
        ├── backward body (written or tape-derived)
        │      auto_chunk + OutlineIncoreScopes       → backward InCore functions (1..N_b)
        │      (N_b independent of N_f)
        ▼
Forward InCore set   ⟂   Backward InCore set     (matched only at the function level)
```

So the contract the programmer sees is: *write the backward once, at the math level; the compiler produces whatever set of backward InCore kernels fits the AI core.* This is both the most convenient for the programmer and the most efficient for the hardware.

---

## 8. Backward Graph: Is a "Tape" Needed, or Just fan-in/fan-out?

This section answers a sharp design question: **do we actually need an autograd "tape", or is the backward simply a set of submitted backward task nodes already tracked by the existing tensormap fan-in/fan-out?** The answer hinges on a granularity observation the reader should hold onto:

> **Task submission and tensormap fan-in/fan-out operate at the InCore level. But backward is not defined per InCore — it is defined per *differentiable function*.** The InCore decomposition of a forward function is a tiling artifact with **no per-InCore backward**. Therefore the incore-level reverse graph is *not* the backward graph, and cannot be mechanically derived by reversing the incore tensormap.

### 8.1 Two distinct jobs — keep them separate

There are two completely different jobs, and conflating them is the source of the confusion:

| Job | What it does | Who does it |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| **(A) Construction** | Decide *which* backward functions to run, *in what order*, bound to *which* saved context — i.e. build/derive the backward graph | needs **differentiable-function-level** information |
| **(B) Execution + reclaim** | Once backward tasks are submitted, schedule them when inputs are ready, run them, and reclaim their buffers | the existing **InCore-level tensormap fan-in/fan-out**, unchanged |

The existing fan-in/fan-out fully handles **(B)** and needs no tape. The "tape" exists **only for (A)**. So the precise answer to the question is:

- **Execution of backward needs no tape** — submitted backward InCore tasks are tracked by fan-in/fan-out exactly like forward tasks, and memory is reclaimed by the same ring rules. Backward is "just more orchestration."
- **Construction of backward needs a differentiable-function-level record** — and *that* record is what we loosely call the tape. It cannot be the incore tensormap, because of the granularity mismatch above.

### 8.2 Why fan-in/fan-out alone cannot derive backward (the granularity argument)

Suppose we tried to skip the tape and "just reverse the tensormap." Concretely, take the flash-attention forward in §10.2:

- Forward `auto_chunk` outlines, say, `N_f` InCore kernels (one per query-block × kv-block tile step), and the tensormap records incore-level producer/consumer edges among their tile buffers (`s`, `p`, `acc`, …).
- Reversing those edges gives you a reverse graph **over forward tiles** — but there is *no backward kernel attached to any of those incore edges*. The backward of flash attention is a **different loop nest** (kv-outer / q-inner, `atomic_add` on `dq`, transposed matmuls; §10.2) producing `N_b` backward InCore kernels with `N_b ≠ N_f` and different shapes (§7).
- So the reversed incore graph is structurally unrelated to the backward incore graph. You cannot get backward by reversing fan-in/fan-out; the reversal happens **one level up**, at the differentiable-function node, whose backward body is then *freshly outlined* into its own incore kernels.

This is the whole reason a separate, higher-granularity structure is required. It mirrors PyTorch: the backward graph is a graph of `grad_fn` **nodes** (logical ops), not a reversal of the kernels each op happened to launch (reference doc §"反向图执行时怎么对应保留数据").

### 8.3 What the tape actually is (and how thin it is)

The "tape" is the PyPTO analog of PyTorch's `grad_fn` graph, recorded at **differentiable-function granularity** — one node per logical op, **not** per InCore submission and **not** per tile:

```
GradNode {                       # one per differentiable-function INVOCATION
    backward_fn:  the function's backward body (custom) or its tape-derived reverse
    saved_ctx:    handles to SAVED buffers + meta (from ctx.save_for_backward / ctx.meta)
    in_edges:     gradient producers  -> input tensors' grad accumulators
    out_edges:    gradient consumers   <- output tensors' grad
}
```

Two equivalent representations of the same information:

1. **Linear tape** — an append-only list, one `GradNode` per differentiable-function call, in forward submission order.
2. **grad_fn DAG anchored on logical tensors** — each gradient-tracked *logical* tensor carries a `grad_fn` handle; nodes are linked by `in_edges`/`out_edges` (PyTorch style).

Both are tiny: their size is proportional to the number of **logical ops** (e.g. layers × ops-per-layer), not to the number of incore tasks or tiles. For a transformer this is hundreds of nodes, while the incore tensormap holds orders of magnitude more task slots. The tape overhead is therefore negligible.

### 8.3.1 Building `in_edges` and `out_edges`: when and how

The two edge sets have **opposite construction timings**, and both are built by reusing the producer/consumer lookup the orchestrator already performs for the tensormap — just one level up, on *logical tensors* instead of incore buffers. Define them precisely against forward data flow. For a differentiable-function invocation `F` with forward inputs `{a, b, …}` and outputs `{y, …}`:

| Edge | Direction | Meaning | Built when |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| `in_edges` | toward F's **inputs** (downstream in backward) | where `F.bwd` *sends* the input-gradients it computes (`grad_a, grad_b`) → the GradNodes that **produced** `a, b` | **eagerly, at F's creation** (producer lookup) |
| `out_edges` | toward F's **outputs** (upstream in backward) | where `F.bwd` *receives* its upstream gradient `grad_y` from → the GradNodes that **consume** `y` | **incrementally**, as consumers appear |

**`in_edges` — built immediately, by producer lookup.** When `F` is invoked in forward, each input tensor `a` *already exists* and carries a `grad_fn` handle pointing to the GradNode that produced it (a parameter/leaf points to its `AccumulateGrad` sink). So at the moment `F` is recorded, the runtime resolves `in_edges[F] = { grad_fn(a), grad_fn(b), … }` in O(#inputs). This is the **exact analog** of the tensormap's fan-in resolution at submit time ("for each input, find its producer"), performed on logical tensors. It is complete the instant `F` is created — nothing is back-patched.

**`out_edges` — accumulate over time, by consumer registration.** `F`'s outputs have **no consumers yet** when `F` is created (the orchestrator is sequential; future consumers are unknown — the same reason the forward `fanout_count` grows over a scope, §`pl.free` doc). So `out_edges[F]` cannot be finalized at creation. Instead, each *later* node `G` that consumes `y` registers itself: when `G` is created and does its producer lookup, it adds `G` to `producer(y).out_edges` (i.e. to `F.out_edges`). Thus `out_edges` **grows as consumers are submitted**, exactly mirroring how the tensormap accumulates `fanout`.

**The minimal implementation stores only `in_edges` (PyTorch does the same).** `out_edges` need not be stored explicitly — they are the reverse of other nodes' `in_edges`. What backward actually needs from the output side is a **count**: how many gradient contributions will arrive at `F`'s outputs, so it knows when `grad_y` is complete. That count is precisely `|out_edges[F]|` = the **forward fan-out of `F`'s outputs**, which the tensormap already maintains (§8.5). So:

```
on creating GradNode F (during forward):
    for each forward input a of F:
        p = grad_fn(a)                 # producer lookup (O(1) via tensor handle)
        in_edges[F].append(p)          # F.bwd will send grad_a to p
        p.pending_grad_count += 1      # == p's output fan-out; how many grads p must accumulate
    for each forward output y of F:
        grad_fn(y) = F                 # publish F as y's producer for later consumers
```

**Backward consumes the edges in the opposite order it built them:**

```
loss.backward():
    seed grad(loss) = 1
    for F in reverse(tape):                         # reverse submission order (§8.4)
        grad_y = gather/accumulate the contributions sent to F's outputs
        grad_inputs = submit F.backward_fn(saved_ctx[F], grad_y)
        for (p, grad_a) in zip(in_edges[F], grad_inputs):
            route grad_a to p          # atomic_add into the accumulator p will read
            p.pending_grad_count -= 1  # when it hits 0, p's grad_y is complete
```

So the timing is symmetric and requires **no separate graph-building pass**: `in_edges` are fixed at forward creation (producer lookup); the `out_edges`/`pending_grad_count` accumulate during forward (consumer registration); backward simply walks the tape in reverse, sending input-gradients along `in_edges` and accumulating per the count. This is the autograd-level mirror of the tensormap's submit-time fan-in + accumulating fan-out, which is why it adds no new scheduling concept (§8.5).

### 8.4 A useful property: reverse-of-submission-order is a valid backward order

Because the orchestrator is sequential, the forward submission order is a valid topological order of the differentiable-function DAG. Its **reverse is automatically a valid backward submission order**: any node's gradient inputs come from ops that were submitted *after* it in forward, hence submitted *before* it in the reversed walk. So a simple append-only list, walked backwards, yields correct backward submission **without an explicit topological sort** — even for non-chain DAGs. (Multi-consumer tensors still need gradient *accumulation*; see §8.5.)

### 8.5 How the two layers cooperate (and what the tensormap contributes)

`loss.backward()` walks the tape/grad_fn graph in reverse; for each `GradNode` it **submits** that node's backward body. From that point the existing machinery takes over:

- The submitted backward body is outlined into backward InCore tasks (§7) which enter the **same tensormap**; fan-in/fan-out schedules them when their inputs (upstream grads + saved ctx) are ready, and the ring reclaims their buffers — identical to forward.
- **Gradient accumulation reuses forward fan-out counts.** A forward tensor consumed by *k* differentiable functions receives *k* gradient contributions in backward. The forward **fan-out count** the tensormap already computed is exactly the number of contributions to accumulate into that tensor's `.grad` — so the existing counter informs backward's accumulation fan-in (via `atomic_add` into `.grad`, or an explicit accumulate node). This is the one place forward fan-in/fan-out data directly feeds backward construction.

So the relationship is **complementary, not either/or**:

| Concern | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Which backward fn, what order, which saved ctx | tape / grad_fn graph (differentiable-function level) |
| How many grad contributions to accumulate per tensor | reuse forward **fan-out count** from tensormap |
| Scheduling/parallelism of submitted backward InCore tasks | tensormap **fan-in/fan-out** (InCore level), unchanged |
| Reclaiming backward task & buffer memory | ring rules (`ref_count == fanout_count` + scope token), unchanged |

### 8.6 Decision

- **Yes, we need a tape — but a thin one, and only for backward *construction*.** It is a differentiable-function-level grad_fn graph, the minimal record that the incore tensormap structurally cannot provide.
- **No, we do not duplicate scheduling/memory logic.** Backward *execution and reclamation* are pure fan-in/fan-out on the existing tensormap; submitted backward InCore tasks are tracked exactly like forward tasks.
- The tape is built dynamically during forward (define-by-run, mirroring PyTorch eager; reference doc §"正向图和反向图是同时构建的吗"), which is natural because the orchestrator is already a sequential, define-by-run program.

### 8.7 Eager Tape vs `torch.compile`-style AOT: Comparison and Recommendation

Both approaches do the same **job (A)** — differentiable-function-level reverse construction — and both hand off **job (B)** (execution + reclaim) to the incore tensormap fan-in/fan-out. They differ only in **when** job (A) happens and whether a whole-program joint graph is materialized.

#### 8.7.1 The two approaches

- **Eager (define-by-run), §8.1–§8.6.** Build the tape/edges at runtime during forward (§8.3.1); `backward()` walks it in reverse and submits backward bodies. No global fwd+bwd graph; each step rebuilds the tape.
- **AOT (`torch.compile` / AOTAutograd-style).** At compile time, trace forward **and** backward together into one **joint graph**, run a **partitioner** to split it into forward and backward graphs, and emit an explicit backward orchestration program. No runtime tape; backward is precompiled code. (Reference doc Part 1 describes exactly this: Dynamo capture → AOTAutograd joint trace → min-cut partitioner → backend.)

#### 8.7.2 What the AOT approach buys (benefits / savings)

1. **No per-step construction overhead.** The tape and edges are built **once** at compile time, not every step. For a fixed training inner loop this removes all runtime graph-building cost.
2. **Whole-graph (fwd+bwd) optimization.** With the joint graph visible, the compiler can **fuse across the fwd/bwd boundary**, eliminate dead gradient computations, reorder for locality, and co-tile a forward incore and its backward — optimizations the eager path cannot see because it never holds both at once.
3. **Automatic save-vs-recompute (the big one for training memory).** A **min-cut rematerialization partitioner** decides, globally, *which activations to SAVE and which to RECOMPUTE in backward* to minimize a cost model. In our memory design (Part 2) this is precisely **automatic selection of the SAVED-stack contents** — i.e. automatic gradient checkpointing — replacing the programmer's manual `with pl.checkpoint()` (§6.3) with a compiler decision that minimizes the SAVED peak (Part 2 §12, §18).
4. **Static memory planning.** With shapes known, the **SAVED stack size, ring-layer capacities, and arena layout are computed at compile time** (feeds the capacity tuning of the ring profiler, §13.10). Allocation becomes deterministic — no runtime ring-full stalls, no surprises.
5. **Ahead-of-time backward incore outlining.** Backward bodies are outlined/tiled (§7) once at compile time and cached, rather than re-derived per step.

In short, AOT trades dynamism for **speed (no per-step build) + memory (automatic rematerialization + static planning) + global optimization**.

#### 8.7.3 Does AOT support dynamic control flow and dynamic shapes?

Only **partially**, and that is its central limitation (reference doc Part 2 covers this in depth):

| Capability | Eager tape | AOT (compiled) |
|------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Data-dependent control flow** (`if x.sum()>0`, variable-length loops) | **Native** — each step records the path actually taken; backward matches it exactly | **Graph break** (split into subgraphs, compile each, backward per-subgraph — correct but loses cross-break fusion), **or** structured higher-order ops (`cond` / `while_loop` / `scan`) that trace *all* branches into the graph |
| **Static-int / shape-driven loops** | Native | **Specialization**: compile one variant per concrete value, cache & reuse |
| **Dynamic shapes** (varying seq-len / batch) | Native — shapes are just runtime values | **Symbolic shapes (SymInt)** with possible **recompilation/specialization** per shape bucket; works but adds compile variants |
| **Data-dependent shapes** (`x[mask]`, output size depends on values) | Native | **Hardest** — unbacked symbolic shapes or graph break |

So: eager handles *all* dynamism for free; AOT handles static/symbolic cases well (with specialization/recompilation) and falls back to **graph breaks** for genuinely data-dependent control flow and shapes — each break costing a lost optimization window and an eager seam.

#### 8.7.4 Recommendation: eager baseline, AOT per-function later (hybrid)

**Recommended: start eager; add a compiled path at the differentiable-function granularity as an optimization. Adopt a hybrid in the long run.**

- **Eager is the right baseline for PyPTO.** The orchestrator is *already* a sequential define-by-run program, so the eager tape (§8.3.1) is a small, natural overlay; it supports full dynamism, is simplest to get correct, and matches the dynamic, shape-varying workloads PyPTO already targets in serving.
- **The differentiable function is the natural compile unit.** Each function's body is mostly **static tile algebra** (excellent to trace, partition, and rematerialize), while the **model-level orchestration** (how many layers, control flow, variable shapes) is where dynamism lives. So compile **inside** each differentiable function (joint fwd+bwd trace + min-cut rematerialization + static SAVED/arena planning **for that function**), and keep the **outer orchestration eager**. This is exactly `torch.compile`'s "compiled regions between graph breaks," but with a principled boundary: the graph break *is* the differentiable-function boundary, which we already treat as the tape granularity (§3, §7).
- **Why this captures most of the benefit:** the per-step overhead and the rematerialization/memory wins (§8.7.2 items 3–5) accrue mostly **within** functions (a transformer layer's attention/MLP), which are static; the outer loop's dynamism (layer count, seq-len buckets) is preserved eagerly. Functions are compiled once and **cached per shape bucket** (symbolic shapes / specialization), reused across steps and layers.
- **Already-present AOT in PyPTO:** note that incore outlining (`auto_chunk`, §7) is *already* compile-time. The eager-vs-AOT question is therefore narrowly about whether the **joint fwd+bwd graph, the save-vs-recompute decision, and cross-function memory planning** are done at runtime (eager tape) or compile time (AOT). The hybrid pushes those into the per-function compile while keeping model-level assembly dynamic.

| Aspect | Eager (baseline) | AOT (later) | Hybrid (recommended target) |
|--------|------------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Per-step build cost | per step | none | none within functions |
| Auto rematerialization (§8.7.2-3) | manual `pl.checkpoint` | automatic, global | automatic per function |
| Static SAVED/arena planning | runtime | full-program | per function |
| Dynamic control flow / shapes | full | graph-break / specialize | **full at outer level**, compiled inside |
| Implementation complexity | low | high | medium |

**Bottom line:** ship **eager** first (correct, fully dynamic, minimal new machinery); evolve to a **per-differentiable-function compiled path** for the static inner loop to harvest automatic rematerialization and static memory planning, while the eager outer orchestration preserves dynamic control flow and dynamic shapes. Both paths reuse the same differentiable-function granularity and the same fan-in/fan-out execution core, so they coexist without a redesign.

## 9. Saved-Context Lifetime — Preview of the Memory Design (Part 2)

This part fixes only the **DSL-visible** lifetime semantics; the concrete ring/heap scheme is Part 2. The DSL commitments are:

1. A tensor passed to `ctx.save_for_backward` enters lifetime class **`SAVED`**. It is **not** reclaimed at forward scope exit (unlike a normal activation). It is reclaimed only after the backward function that consumes it has executed.
2. `save_for_backward` is **copy-free at the DSL level**: it does not logically duplicate data. The runtime realizes this by allocating the saved output **directly in a separate region** (not the ring), with a physical copy only as a fallback for views / retroactive saves (full scheme in Part 2 §13, §15.3).
3. Gradient buffers (`t.grad`) are allocated by the backward pass and follow backward's own lifetime, not forward's.

### 9.1 Questions explicitly deferred to Part 2 (raised by the user)

These are listed here so Part 1 stays scoped to the DSL, and answered next:

- **Copy vs pin:** must we allocate and keep a *separate copy* of saved forward context for backward, or can we pin the original forward buffer in place? (Pinning saved buffers inside a forward ring breaks the ring's monotone head advance — likely motivating a separate region.)
- **Backward ring/stack scheme:** backward should reuse a stack-/ring-style scheme analogous to forward, but it runs in roughly *reverse* order, which changes the allocation/free pattern (LIFO vs FIFO). Propose the adapted scheme that maximizes release/reuse once a datum's life cycle expires.
- **How many heaps?** The user's specific question: do we need **three** separate memory regions —
  1. forward stack/ring (transient forward activations),
  2. backward stack/ring (transient backward intermediates + gradients),
  3. saved-context region (the `SAVED` class that bridges forward → backward)?

  Part 1's lifetime classes (`TRANSIENT_FWD`, `SAVED`, `TRANSIENT_BWD`) already suggest the answer is **yes, three lifetime classes**, but whether they map to three physical heaps, or to layered rings within fewer heaps, is the Part 2 decision.

## 10. Worked Examples

### 10.1 A Simple Differentiable Primitive (`Linear`)

```python
# Custom differentiable primitive: linear layer y = x @ w  (+ saves x, w)
@pl.autograd_function
class Linear:
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, x, w):
        with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk]):
            y = pl.matmul(x, w)
        ctx.save_for_backward(x, w)          # x, w → lifetime class SAVED
        return y

    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, dy):
        x, w = ctx.saved_tensors
        with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk]):
            dx = pl.matmul(dy, pl.transpose(w))     # tiled independently of forward
            dw = pl.matmul(pl.transpose(x), dy)
        return dx, dw

# Composite model: no backward written; reversed from the tape
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Opaque, differentiable=True)
def tiny_mlp(self, x, w1, w2, target):
    h = relu(Linear.apply(x, w1))      # differentiable function call -> tape entry
    y = Linear.apply(h, w2)            # tape entry
    loss = mse(y, target)              # tape entry
    return loss

# Training step (orchestrator-level, define-by-run)
loss = tiny_mlp(x, w1, w2, target)     # forward: builds tensormap DAG + autograd tape
loss.backward()                        # walks tape in reverse, submits backward funcs
# w1.grad, w2.grad now populated; optimizer step is Part 3
```

What happens:

- Forward submits forward InCore kernels (today's path) **plus** records 3 tape entries and promotes `x, w1, w2, h` (as declared) to `SAVED`.
- `backward()` walks `[mse, Linear(h,w2), Linear(x,w1)]` in reverse, each submitting backward InCore kernels — **a different number and shape** than the forward kernels (§7).
- Saved buffers are released as their backward consumers finish (Part 2 scheme).

### 10.2 Flash Attention (realistic): forward and backward

This is the example that best exercises every Part 1 decision at once. It is written for one attention head with sequence length `S` and head dim `d`; batch and heads are parallelised by the caller (or by an outer `pl.parallel` loop). It uses the same tile-algebra primitives as the production attention kernels in `pypto-lib` (`pl.matmul`, `pl.transpose`, `pl.row_max`, `pl.row_sum`, `pl.exp`, `pl.row_expand_sub`, `pl.row_expand_mul`, `pl.row_expand_div`, `pl.atomic_add`, …).

The key training-specific moves are flagged inline.

```python
import pypto.language as pl

Q_BLK = 128     # query-block tile (forward outer loop)
K_BLK = 128     # key/value-block tile (forward inner loop)
NEG_INF = -3.0e38

@pl.autograd_function
class FlashAttention:
    # ---- FORWARD : online-softmax flash attention ------------------------
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, q, k, v, scale, causal):
        # q, k, v : [S, d]  (FP32 / BF16);  scale = 1/sqrt(d)
        with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk]):
            o   = pl.create_tensor([S, d], dtype=pl.FP32)   # attention output
            lse = pl.create_tensor([S, 1], dtype=pl.FP32)   # log-sum-exp row stat
            # Forward loop nest: OUTER over query blocks, INNER over KV blocks.
            for qi in pl.parallel(0, S, Q_BLK, chunk=1):
                q_blk = pl.slice(q, [Q_BLK, d], [qi, 0])

        # gradients line up with forward inputs (q,k,v); meta args get None.
        return dq, dk, dv, None, None
```

What this example demonstrates about Part 1:

1. **Saved context is the memory lever (§5.3).** Forward keeps only `q,k,v,o` and the `[S,1]` `lse`. A naïve autograd would have to retain the full `[S,S]` attention-probability matrix `p` per block; flash attention saves the `O(S)` statistic and **recomputes** `p` in backward. `ctx.save_for_backward` is what tells the runtime these (and only these) survive forward scope exit as class `SAVED`; everything else (`s`, `p`, `m`, `l`, `acc`) stays `TRANSIENT_FWD` and is reclaimed at forward scope exit exactly as in inference today.
2. **Backward ≠ forward at the InCore level (§7).** The backward loop nest is transposed (KV-outer / Q-inner), `dk`/`dv` accumulate inside a KV block while `dq` accumulates across KV blocks via `pl.atomic_add`, and the matmul operands are transposed. `auto_chunk` therefore outlines a **different set, count and tile shape** of backward InCore kernels than forward — there is no 1:1 correspondence, and forcing one would be wrong.
3. **Backward is written once in tile algebra (§6.2).** No "InCore backward kernel" is hand-written; the same `pl.at(... auto_chunk)` machinery tiles the backward body to its own SRAM budget (note backward's working set additionally holds `dq/dk/dv` accumulators, so its optimal tile size legitimately differs from forward's).
4. **`ctx.meta` carries non-tensor args (§5.1).** `scale` and `causal` ride on `ctx.meta`, cost no buffer, and the corresponding `backward` return slots are `None` (they are not differentiable) — exactly the PyTorch convention.
5. **Recompute/checkpoint is implicit here, explicit elsewhere (§6.3).** Flash attention already recomputes `p` by construction; a programmer could push further (e.g. wrap surrounding blocks in `with pl.checkpoint():`) to trade more compute for memory.

Tape view (§8): one `FlashAttention` call appends exactly **one** TapeEntry whose `saved_ctx` is `{q,k,v,o,lse, scale, causal}`. `loss.backward()` reaching this entry submits the backward body above; its InCore kernels flow through the same submit / tensormap / ring path as any forward kernel.

## 11. Summary of Part 1 Decisions

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Follow PyTorch `ctx.save_for_backward`? | **Yes**; add `ctx.save_for_backward` (tensors) + `ctx.meta` (non-tensor). It is the lifetime hook into the memory manager (§5). |
| 2 | New grammar for "what to save"? | **Yes**; `save_for_backward` promotes buffers to lifetime class `SAVED`; programmer chooses output-vs-input / mask to minimize memory (§5.3). |
| 3 | Build backward graph dynamically during forward? Do we need a "tape"? | **Yes, dynamically.** A **thin tape** (grad_fn graph at *differentiable-function* granularity) is needed only for backward **construction**; backward **execution + reclaim** is pure tensormap fan-in/fan-out, unchanged. The incore tensormap cannot derive backward because of the granularity mismatch — submission is per-InCore, backward is per-differentiable-function (§8). |
| 4 | Must every forward InCore have a matching backward InCore? | **No**; match only at the differentiable-function level. Compiler outlines forward and backward **independently**, each tiled to its own SRAM constraints (§7). |
| 5 | How to let the programmer describe backward conveniently? | Write `backward` once in **tile algebra** at the same level as forward; compiler does the InCore outlining/tiling (§6). Composite functions need no backward. |
| 6 | Memory: copy saved context? backward ring scheme? three heaps? | **Deferred to Part 2.** Part 1 fixes three lifetime classes (`TRANSIENT_FWD`, `SAVED`, `TRANSIENT_BWD`) which strongly suggest three regions; physical layout decided next (§9). |

---

**Part 2 (below):** memory management for training — saved-context copy-vs-pin, the backward ring/stack scheme adapted for reverse-order execution, and whether the three lifetime classes map to three physical heaps.

---

# Part 2 — Memory Management for Training

Part 1 fixed the DSL-visible lifetime semantics and named three lifetime classes. Part 2 answers the three concrete memory questions the user raised:

- **Copy vs pin** — must we keep a *separate copy* of the saved forward context for backward, or can we pin the forward buffer in place (§13)?
- **Backward ring scheme** — backward executes in roughly *reverse* order; what allocation/free discipline maximizes release and reuse once a datum's life cycle expires (§14, §15)?
- **How many heaps** — do we need three physical regions (forward ring, backward ring, saved context), or fewer (§16)?

The whole of Part 2 builds on the existing forward mechanism — the **multi-layer ring stack** indexed by scope depth, with reclamation gated by `scope-token applied` **and** `ref_count == fanout_count` (see `multi_level_runtime_ring_and_pypto_free_api.md`). Training **reuses** these rules; it does not replace them.

## 12. The Central Insight: SAVED Activations Are LIFO

Before choosing data structures, observe the access pattern of saved activations across a deep model. For an `N`-layer network:

```
forward  (push order):   save(L1), save(L2), ..., save(L{N-1}), save(LN)
backward (consume order): use(LN), use(L{N-1}), ..., use(L2),   use(L1)
```

**Saved activations are consumed in the exact reverse of the order they were produced.** This is a textbook **stack (LIFO)** discipline: forward *pushes*, backward *pops*. This single fact drives every Part 2 decision:

- A **stack allocator** is the natural fit for the SAVED class: zero fragmentation, monotonic growth in forward, monotonic shrink in backward, O(1) push/pop.
- The SAVED stack reaches its **peak exactly at the forward→backward boundary** and then drains. This is the well-known "activation memory dominates training" peak (reference doc §"内存占用问题确实严重").
- It is **not** scope-depth-layered like the forward transient ring: a saved activation deliberately *outlives* its forward scope, so it lives in a region ordered by tape position (production order), not by `current_scope_depth`.

> The LIFO property is what lets us avoid both extra copies and a third heap. The rest of Part 2 is essentially "exploit LIFO."

### 12.1 When LIFO is not strict: residual / skip connections

Strict LIFO holds when each saved tensor is consumed only by its own function's backward. **Skip/residual connections break strict LIFO**: a tensor saved early in forward may be consumed by a backward node that runs *before* the natural stack top (e.g. a residual add whose gradient flows to a much earlier layer). We therefore make the SAVED region **stack-dominant but ref-count-correct**: the *common* case pops the top; the *exceptional* out-of-order release is handled by the existing `ref_count == fanout_count` rule plus a small intra-region free-list (§15.2). No correctness depends on strict LIFO; only peak-efficiency does.

## 13. Copy vs Pin: Route Saved Outputs Directly Into the SAVED Region

### 13.1 Why pinning inside the forward ring is wrong

The forward transient ring works precisely because reclamation is roughly FIFO at the head: `last_task_alive[d]` advances and slots are reclaimed in order. If we "pin" a SAVED buffer in place inside `buffer_ring[d]` (mark it un-reclaimable until backward), it becomes a **hole that blocks head advancement**: every transient allocated *before* the pinned buffer cannot be reclaimed past it, destroying the ring discipline and inflating peak forward memory by potentially the entire forward span. **Pinning in the transient ring is therefore rejected.**

### 13.2 Why an extra copy is (usually) unnecessary

A naïve fix is: compute the activation in the forward ring, then **copy** it out into the SAVED stack. That wastes bandwidth and briefly doubles the buffer. We avoid it: because `ctx.save_for_backward` is known **at submission time** (it is a static annotation of which outputs are saved — §5), the orchestrator can **allocate the saved output directly in the SAVED stack** from the start. The producing InCore task writes its output straight into the SAVED region; it never occupies a transient ring slot. **No copy, no pin, no ring hole.**

### 13.3 The decision

| Situation | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| Saved tensor is a **direct InCore output**, known saved at submission | **Allocate-in-place in the SAVED stack** (no copy). Default and common case. |
| Saved tensor is a **view/slice** of a transient buffer, or saved **retroactively** | **Relocate (copy) once** into the SAVED stack at the save point; release the transient. |
| Saved tensor equals a **persistent input** (e.g. a weight already resident) | **No save at all** — reference the persistent buffer; record only a handle in `saved_ctx`. |

So the answer to "do we need to allocate and save a new copy of the saved forward context?" is: **generally no.** The datum is computed **once** and lives in the SAVED region for its whole fwd→bwd lifetime; a copy is only the fallback for views or retroactive saves.

## 14. The Backward Transient Region: Reuse the Multi-Layer Ring Stack

Backward intermediates (`TRANSIENT_BWD`: the recomputed `p`, `ds`, `dp`, the `dq/dk/dv` accumulators within one backward function, etc.) have **exactly the same lifetime shape as forward transients** — they are born and die *within* the execution of a single backward differentiable-function body, which itself runs a sequential `pl.at` orchestration with nested scopes.

Therefore `TRANSIENT_BWD` **reuses the existing multi-layer ring stack mechanism unchanged**:

- Each backward function body opens scopes (`pl.scope` / `pl.at`); `current_scope_depth` indexes ring layers exactly as in forward.
- Reclamation uses the identical rule: scope-token applied **and** `ref_count == fanout_count`; `pl.free` works identically for early release inside a backward scope.
- The "reverse order" of backward is a property of the **tape walk** (§8), *not* of the ring: within any one backward body, allocation/free is forward-like and sequential. The ring never sees "reverse"; it only sees another stream of submit/retire events.

This is the key simplification: **backward does not need a new memory algorithm.** It needs the same ring-stack, fed by the backward submissions the tape produces.

## 15. How the Pieces Fit: the SAVED Stack ⟂ the Transient Ring

### 15.1 Two regions, growing toward each other

Place the two activation regions at opposite ends of one arena:

```
|<==== TRANSIENT ring-stack (forward, then backward) ====>|        |<==== SAVED stack ====|
arena_lo ......................................................................... arena_hi
            grows/shrinks per scope depth                    grows in fwd, shrinks in bwd
```

- **Forward:** SAVED grows from `arena_hi` downward (push per saved activation); TRANSIENT_FWD churns near `arena_lo` (ring-stack per scope). They are farthest apart in mid-forward and closest at the fwd→bwd boundary, where SAVED is at peak.
- **Backward:** SAVED *shrinks* (pop as each backward consumer finishes); TRANSIENT_BWD churns near `arena_lo`. As SAVED drains, **the freed high memory is immediately available to backward transients and intermediate gradients** — the two trade space precisely when each needs it.

This double-ended layout means peak memory is `peak_SAVED + max-over-time(transient_occupancy)`, with the SAVED peak (end of forward) overlapping the *small* early-backward transient, and the *large* late-backward transient overlapping an *already-drained* SAVED. The arena self-balances.

### 15.2 SAVED region internals

- Primary discipline: **bump-pointer stack** from `arena_hi`. `push` on save, `pop` on top-of-stack release.
- Out-of-order release (skip connections, §12.1): when a non-top SAVED buffer reaches `ref_count == fanout_count`, mark its span free and record it in a small **free-list**; coalesce into the stack pointer when the top is popped. This bounds fragmentation to the (small) number of live skip connections.
- A SAVED buffer's `fanout_count` counts its **backward** consumers (how many backward nodes read it), reusing the same counting machinery as forward (the forward fan-out count informs gradient accumulation; the backward fan-out count governs SAVED release — §8.5).

### 15.3 The SAVED LIFO Stack — Detailed Management Strategy

This subsection consolidates the full management strategy for saved activations: why they live outside the ring, why the region is a stack rather than a heap, how they are allocated (without copying), and how they are released.

#### 15.3.1 Requirement: SAVED must not occupy the ring

The forward transient ring (`buffer_ring[d]`, `multi_level_runtime_ring_and_pypto_free_api.md`) is a **contiguous** structure whose reclamation advances a single monotone head (`last_task_alive[d]`). It depends on an approximately FIFO retire order: the oldest allocations free first, the head moves, slots are reused. A `SAVED` buffer violates this by design — its lifetime spans from forward production to a **much later** backward consumption (potentially after the entire forward pass). If a `SAVED` buffer sat inside the ring:

- it would become an **un-reclaimable hole**: the head cannot advance past it, so **every transient allocated before it is also pinned**, even though those transients are dead;
- forward peak memory would balloon toward the **whole forward span**, defeating the ring entirely.

**Therefore `SAVED` tensors are allocated in a separate region**, never in the transient ring. This is a hard structural requirement, not an optimization.

#### 15.3.2 Why a stack, not a general heap

The separate region could be a general allocator (malloc-style heap) or a **bump-pointer stack**. We choose a **stack**, because the access pattern is overwhelmingly **LIFO** (§12): across an `N`-layer model, saved activations are produced `L1→LN` in forward and consumed `LN→L1` in backward. A stack exploits this exactly:

| Property | Bump-pointer **stack** (chosen) | General **heap** |
|----------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| Alloc / free cost | O(1) pointer bump / decrement | O(log n) or free-list search |
| Fragmentation | **None** under pure LIFO | Internal + external fragmentation |
| Peak accounting | exact, monotone (push in fwd, pop in bwd) | requires live-set tracking |
| Fit to access pattern | **native** (push=produce, pop=consume) | indifferent |

The only deviation from pure LIFO is **skip / residual connections** (§12.1), where a value is consumed out of strict stack order. That is a *small, bounded* exception handled by a free-list overlay (§15.3.4), not a reason to abandon the stack for a heap.

#### 15.3.3 Allocation policy: allocate-in-place ≫ copy ≫ reference

The decisive fact is that **`save_for_backward` is known at submission time** (it is a static annotation of which producer outputs are saved — §5, §13). So the runtime almost always avoids both pinning and copying:

| Case | Policy | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| **Direct InCore output**, known saved at submit (the common case) | **Allocate the producer's output buffer directly in the SAVED stack.** The producing kernel writes its result straight into the stack; no ring slot is ever used for it. | **zero** — computed once, in place |
| **View / slice** of a transient buffer, or **retroactive** save | **Copy once** into the SAVED stack at the save point, then release the transient. | one copy (bandwidth + brief double-buffer) |
| Saved tensor **equals a persistent input** (e.g. a resident weight) | **Reference only** — record a handle in `saved_ctx`; store nothing. | zero, no storage |

So the answer to "separate region or copy-on-save?" is: **a separate stack region is the structural choice; within it, prefer allocate-in-place (no copy); fall back to copy only for views / retroactive saves; reference persistent inputs.** A blanket copy-on-`save_for_backward` would needlessly pay bandwidth for the common direct-output case.

#### 15.3.4 Lifecycle and out-of-order release

```
push  (forward, at produce):   sp -= size(t);  t.addr = sp;   t.fanout_count = (#backward consumers)
read  (backward, on consume):  t.ref_count += 1
free  (backward):              when t.ref_count == t.fanout_count:
                                   if t is at stack top (t.addr == sp):  sp += size(t)        # pop
                                                                         coalesce any adjacent freed spans
                                   else:                                  add [t.addr, size] to free-list  # skip-conn case
```

- **Pure-LIFO path:** the backward consumer of the most-recently-saved tensor runs first, so the top pops first; `sp` rises monotonically and the region drains to empty by end of backward.
- **Skip-connection path:** a residual makes a non-top buffer reach `ref_count == fanout_count` early; its span goes to a small **free-list** and is coalesced into `sp` when the buffers above it pop. Fragmentation is bounded by the number of simultaneously-live skip connections (typically O(1) per residual depth), so the stack discipline is preserved in practice.
- The release trigger is the **same `ref_count == fanout_count` rule** used everywhere (§17); only the counted consumers are the tensor's **backward** readers (§8.5). No new reclamation algorithm.

#### 15.3.5 Invariants

1. **Ring isolation:** no `SAVED` buffer ever occupies a transient ring slot; the ring head is never blocked by a saved activation.
2. **No logical copy:** each saved datum is materialized **once**; a physical copy occurs only in the view / retroactive fallback (§15.3.3), never for direct outputs.
3. **Monotone in the common case:** under pure LIFO, `sp` decreases only in forward and increases only in backward; peak `SAVED` is reached exactly at the forward→backward boundary (§19).
4. **Bounded fragmentation:** free-list entries exist only for live skip connections and are coalesced on pop.
5. **Same release rule:** retirement uses `ref_count == fanout_count` with backward-consumer counting; the SAVED scope-token fires when those consumers complete (§17).

#### 15.3.6 Placement in the arena

The SAVED stack is the high-address end of the double-ended activation arena (§15.1): it grows **downward** from `arena_hi` during forward and **shrinks upward** during backward, while the transient ring churns at `arena_lo`. As backward pops the SAVED stack, the freed high memory becomes immediately available to backward transients (`TRANSIENT_BWD`) — the two trade space precisely when each needs it, so peak ≈ `peak_SAVED + small early-backward transient`.

## 16. How Many Heaps? — Three Classes, Two Activation Regions, One Persistent Region

The user's question: do we need three separate heaps (forward ring, backward ring, saved context)? The answer rests on a **temporal-disjointness** observation:

> In the standard forward-then-backward schedule, **all `TRANSIENT_FWD` buffers are reclaimed before any `TRANSIENT_BWD` buffer is allocated.** Forward transients die at forward scope exit; backward transients are born only once `backward()` starts. The two never coexist.

Therefore `TRANSIENT_FWD` and `TRANSIENT_BWD` **share one physical region** (the transient ring-stack), used by forward during forward and by backward during backward. We do **not** need a separate backward ring heap.

Final mapping:

| Lifetime class (logical) | Physical region | Discipline | Active during |
|--------------------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|
| `TRANSIENT_FWD` | **Transient region** (shared) | multi-layer ring stack | forward |
| `TRANSIENT_BWD` | **Transient region** (shared) | multi-layer ring stack | backward |
| `SAVED` | **Saved region** | bump-pointer stack + free-list | forward (push) → backward (pop) |
| *(params, param-grads, optimizer state)* | **Persistent region** | allocated once, not ring/stack-managed | whole training step (Part 3) |

**Answer: three lifetime classes, but only two activation regions** (Transient + Saved), best arranged as a single **double-ended arena** (§15.1). A separate **persistent region** holds parameters, their gradients, and optimizer state — but that is not activation memory and is detailed in Part 3.

So we do **not** need three heaps for activations. The third "heap" the question anticipated (a separate backward ring) collapses into the forward transient region by temporal disjointness.

### 16.1 Caveat: schedules that overlap forward and backward

Pipeline-parallel / 1F1B schedules interleave forward of one microbatch with backward of another, so `TRANSIENT_FWD` and `TRANSIENT_BWD` *can* coexist. In that case the shared transient region is partitioned per concurrent stream (or sized for the sum). This is a Part 4 (distributed) concern; the single-stream design here is the base case, and the double-ended arena generalizes by giving each in-flight microbatch its own transient sub-arena while sharing one SAVED stack per microbatch.

## 17. Unified Reclamation Rules (No New Algorithm)

All three classes retire under the **same** condition already used in forward, only the *trigger* differs:

| Class | Scope-token trigger | `ref_count == fanout_count` counts | Reclaim effect |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| `TRANSIENT_FWD` | forward `scope.exit` / `pl.free` | forward consumers | advance `last_task_alive[d]` in transient ring |
| `TRANSIENT_BWD` | backward `scope.exit` / `pl.free` | backward consumers | advance `last_task_alive[d]` in transient ring |
| `SAVED` | implicit token applied when its **backward consumer(s) complete** | **backward** consumers of the saved tensor | pop / free-list in SAVED stack |

The only genuinely new rule is the SAVED scope-token semantics: a SAVED buffer does **not** take the forward `scope.exit` token (that is exactly what would have killed it too early); instead its release token is applied when its recorded backward consumers have run. This is the runtime realization of "promote to lifetime class `SAVED`" from §5.2.

`pl.free` extends naturally: `pl.free(t)` on a SAVED tensor inside backward signals "this saved activation is done early" (e.g. after the last backward use within a manually fused block), popping it before the enclosing backward scope exits — the SAVED analog of the forward `pl.free` early-release optimization.

## 18. Interaction With Recompute / Checkpointing

`with pl.checkpoint()` (§6.3) is the memory lever that trades SAVED for TRANSIENT+compute:

- A checkpointed region saves **nothing** to the SAVED stack (or only its inputs), cutting the SAVED peak.
- During backward, it **recomputes** forward: this recompute runs as ordinary backward-time orchestration in the **transient region**, may push a *short-lived* SAVED sub-stack for the inner backward, then drains it.
- Net effect: SAVED peak ↓, transient churn ↑, compute ↑ — the same min-cut tradeoff described in the reference doc (Part 1 §4), here expressed as "how much of the arena is SAVED vs TRANSIENT." Because the arena is double-ended, converting a function to checkpointed directly shifts arena balance toward TRANSIENT without re-partitioning.

## 19. Worked Timeline (N-layer model, flash-attention layers)

```
t →   forward                                   | backward
─────────────────────────────────────────────── ┼ ───────────────────────────────────────
SAVED  push q,k,v,o,lse (L1)                     | ... (drained)                        ▁
stack  push q,k,v,o,lse (L2)                     | pop  q,k,v,o,lse (LN)            ▁▂▃
       ...                                       | pop  q,k,v,o,lse (L{N-1})    ▁▂▃▅
       push q,k,v,o,lse (LN)        ◀ SAVED peak | pop  q,k,v,o,lse (L1)   ▁▂▃▅▆█  ◀ here SAVED already small
TRANS  L1 fwd transients churn & freed at scope  | LN bwd: recompute p, ds, dq/dk/dv accum…
ring   L2 fwd transients churn & freed at scope  | L{N-1} bwd transients churn
       ...  (each layer's transients die before  | ... (grows as SAVED shrinks — arena trades)
            the next; never all live at once)    |
```

Observations:
1. `TRANSIENT_FWD` peak is **one layer's** working set (they die per scope), not all layers — unchanged from inference.
2. `SAVED` peak is the **sum over layers** of saved-per-layer (`q,k,v,o,lse` ×`N`), the dominant training term; `lse` being `[S,1]` instead of `[S,S]` is the flash-attention win (§10.2, §5.3).
3. `TRANSIENT_BWD` grows as `SAVED` shrinks → arena self-balances; total peak ≈ `peak_SAVED + one_layer_bwd_transient`.

## 20. Profiling Additions (extends the §13.10 ring profiler)

Add per-region metrics so capacity can be tuned for training:

- `saved_stack_peak_bytes`, `saved_stack_peak_at` (should coincide with fwd→bwd boundary)
- `saved_freelist_peak_entries`, `saved_fragmentation_pct` (detect skip-connection pressure)
- `transient_peak_fwd_bytes`, `transient_peak_bwd_bytes` (verify disjointness assumption; if both nonzero simultaneously → overlapped schedule, §16.1)
- `arena_peak_total_bytes = saved + transient` co-timed (the number that must fit device memory)
- `recompute_saved_bytes` / `recompute_extra_compute_us` per checkpointed region (cost/benefit of §18)

CI gate (extends §13.11): hard-fail if `arena_peak_total_bytes` exceeds device budget; warn if `saved_fragmentation_pct` high (suggests a residual that should be relocated or freed with `pl.free`).

## 21. Summary of Part 2 Decisions

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | Copy or pin the saved forward context? | **Neither, normally.** Allocate saved InCore outputs **directly in the SAVED region** at submission time (no copy, no ring pin). Copy only for views / retroactive saves; skip entirely for persistent inputs (§13). |
| 2 | What discipline for SAVED? | A **bump-pointer stack** — saved activations are LIFO (forward push / backward pop). Out-of-order release (skip connections) handled by `ref_count` + a small free-list (§12, §15.2). |
| 3 | Backward ring scheme for reverse-order execution? | **Reuse the existing multi-layer ring stack unchanged.** "Reverse order" lives in the tape walk, not the allocator; within each backward body, allocation is forward-like (§14). |
| 4 | Three separate heaps (fwd ring / bwd ring / saved)? | **No — two activation regions.** `TRANSIENT_FWD` and `TRANSIENT_BWD` are temporally disjoint and **share** one transient ring-stack; `SAVED` is a separate stack. Best laid out as one **double-ended arena** (§16, §15.1). |
| 5 | Where do params / grads / optimizer state go? | A separate **persistent region**, not ring/stack-managed; activation scheme above is independent of it (detailed in Part 3). |
| 6 | New reclamation algorithm needed? | **No.** Same `scope-token + ref_count == fanout_count` rule; only the SAVED scope-token trigger is new (fires when backward consumers complete) (§17). |

**Part 3 (below):** runtime / scheduler changes for the backward pass, gradient accumulation across micro-batches, the persistent region (params / grads / optimizer state), and the optimizer step.

---

# Part 3 — Backward Runtime, Gradient Accumulation, and the Optimizer Step

Parts 1–2 established *what* the programmer writes (differentiable functions, saved context, tape) and *where the bytes live* (transient ring-stack + SAVED stack + persistent region). Part 3 covers *how the runtime executes a full training step*: driving the backward pass, accumulating gradients, the persistent region for parameters/optimizer state, and the optimizer update.

The guiding principle, established in Part 1 §8, carries through: **backward and the optimizer step are "just more orchestration."** They submit InCore tasks through the *same* `submit()` / tensormap / scheduler / worker path as forward (see `simpler_distributed_runtime_design.md`). Part 3 is therefore mostly about **what is added around** that unchanged core, not changes to it.

## 22. A Training Step Is One Orchestration Program

A training step is a single sequential orchestration program with three phases on one orchestrator thread:

```
                 ┌───────────── forward ─────────────┐  ┌──── backward ────┐  ┌── optimizer ──┐
orchestrator:    submit fwd InCore tasks ............. → walk tape in reverse → submit opt InCore
                 record tape (§8) + push SAVED (§13)    submit bwd InCore       step (§27)
                                                        pop SAVED, accumulate
                                                        into .grad (§25)
scheduler:       (unchanged) pop ready_queue → dispatch to workers → completion → fanout release
workers:         (unchanged) run InCore tasks
```

All three phases flow through the existing scheduler/worker machinery; dependencies among their InCore tasks are inferred by the tensormap exactly as today. The orchestrator thread simply keeps submitting: first forward, then (after the loss scalar exists) backward, then the optimizer.

## 23. Runtime / Scheduler Changes: What Stays, What Is New

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| `submit()` / tensormap / fan-in/fan-out | **Unchanged.** Backward & optimizer InCore tasks use it as-is. |
| Scheduler thread, Worker threads, completion queue | **Unchanged.** Backward is another stream of tasks. |
| Multi-layer ring stack (transient) | **Unchanged** mechanism; now also serves `TRANSIENT_BWD` (Part 2 §14, §16). |
| **TapeManager** | **New.** Records grad_fn nodes in forward; replays in reverse on `backward()` (Part 1 §8). |
| **SavedStack / double-ended arena** | **New.** Manages the `SAVED` region and its interplay with the transient region (Part 2 §15). |
| **PersistentAllocator** | **New.** One-time allocation of params, param-grads, optimizer state (§26). |
| **Gradient accumulation** | **New** policy layered on the existing fan-out counter (§25). |
| **Optimizer** | **New** library of non-differentiable orchestrations (§27). |
| **Training-step driver** | **New.** `zero_grad → (fwd → bwd)×accum → step` loop (§28). |

The deliberate outcome: **the hot path (scheduler + workers + tensormap) needs no training-specific change.** Training adds bookkeeping layers around it.

## 24. Seeding and Driving the Backward Pass

`loss.backward()` does three things:

1. **Seed.** Allocate `loss.grad` and initialize it to `1.0` (the `dL/dL` seed; the loss is scalar, so this is a `[1]` buffer). This mirrors PyTorch's implicit seed.
2. **Reverse walk.** Iterate the tape in reverse (Part 1 §8.4: reverse-of-submission-order is a valid backward order). For each `GradNode`, bind its `saved_ctx` and its output-gradient inputs, then **submit** its backward body.
3. **Drain.** The submitted backward InCore tasks schedule via fan-in as their inputs (`saved_ctx` + upstream `.grad`) become ready; `backward()` returns when the tape is exhausted and all backward tasks have retired (the same "all done" condition the orchestrator already uses).

No new scheduling primitive: step 2 is ordinary submission; step 3 is the ordinary drain.

## 25. Gradient Accumulation — Two Distinct Kinds

There are two accumulation problems, with different lifetimes and different homes. Conflating them is a common design error.

### 25.1 Activation-gradient accumulation (transient, intra-pass)

When a forward tensor `t` is consumed by *k* differentiable functions, backward produces *k* gradient contributions that must sum into `t.grad`. As established in Part 1 §8.5, **the forward fan-out count of `t` is exactly `k`** — reuse it. Mechanism:

- `t.grad` is a buffer in the **transient region** (it is itself a `TRANSIENT_BWD` activation: born in backward, dies once consumed by `t`'s producer's backward node).
- Each contributing backward node does `pl.atomic_add(t.grad, contribution)` (or routes into an accumulate node).
- `t.grad` becomes **ready** (schedulable as input to the next backward node) only after all `k` contributions land — encoded as a fan-in count of `k` on `t.grad`, taken directly from the forward fan-out counter. This is the one place forward fan-out data feeds backward construction.
- After `t`'s producer backward node consumes `t.grad`, it retires under the normal `ref_count == fanout_count` rule and its transient slot is reclaimed.

So activation grads need **no special memory**: they are transient buffers governed by the existing ring rules, with their fan-in count borrowed from forward fan-out.

### 25.2 Parameter-gradient accumulation (persistent, intra- and inter-micro-batch)

Parameter gradients are different: a parameter `w` lives in the **persistent region** for the whole training run, and its gradient `w.grad` must accumulate:

- **within one backward pass** (if `w` is used in *k* places, *k* contributions), and
- **across micro-batches** in a gradient-accumulation window (sum gradients over several `(fwd,bwd)` before one optimizer step).

Therefore `w.grad` is a **persistent buffer** (not ring-managed). Each backward node that produces a gradient for `w` does `pl.atomic_add(w.grad, contribution)`. Crucially, `w.grad` is **not** reclaimed between micro-batches — it is zeroed only at the start of the window (§28) and consumed only by the optimizer (§27). There is no `fanout_count` retirement on persistent grads; their lifetime is the accumulation window, managed by the training-step driver, not the ring.

| | Activation grad (`t.grad`) | Parameter grad (`w.grad`) |
|---|---|---|
| Region | transient ring-stack | persistent |
| Accumulate over | one backward pass | one pass **and** across micro-batches |
| Ready / consumed | fan-in count = fwd fan-out; consumed by producer's backward | consumed by optimizer at window end |
| Reclaim | normal ring rule | none; zeroed at next `zero_grad` |

## 26. The Persistent Region: Parameters, Gradients, Optimizer State

The persistent region holds everything whose lifetime is the **whole training run** (many steps), allocated **once** by the `PersistentAllocator`, never ring/stack-managed:

| Item | Bytes (per param element) | Notes |
|------|---------------------------|-------|
| Parameter `w` | 1× (e.g. BF16/FP32 master copy) | declared via `@pl.parameter` (§4) |
| Gradient `w.grad` | 1× | accumulation target (§25.2) |
| Optimizer state | 2× for Adam/AdamW (`m`, `v`); 0× for plain SGD | resident across steps |

For AdamW the persistent footprint is ≈ **4× parameter bytes** (param + grad + m + v), the well-known training-memory tax (reference doc §"训练时显存远大于推理"). This region is **disjoint** from the activation arena of Part 2; total device memory = persistent region + activation arena (`peak_SAVED + peak_transient`, §19).

The persistent region is also where a master FP32 copy lives under mixed precision (BF16 compute params + FP32 master), an extension noted for later.

## 27. The Optimizer Step as Non-Differentiable Orchestration

The optimizer step is an ordinary orchestration function marked `differentiable=False` (no tape, no SAVED, no backward). It reads `(param, grad, state)` from the persistent region and updates `param` and `state` **in place**. Because element-wise updates tile trivially, it outlines into InCore tasks via the usual `pl.at(... auto_chunk)`:

```python
@pl.function(level=pl.Level.CHIP, differentiable=False)
def adamw_step(self, w, g, m, v, lr, beta1, beta2, eps, wd, bc1, bc2):
    # w, g, m, v : persistent [N] buffers; updated in place. bc1/bc2 = bias-correction.
    with pl.at(level=pl.Level.CORE_GROUP, optimizations=[pl.auto_chunk]):
        for i in pl.parallel(0, N, TILE, chunk=1):
            gi = pl.slice(g, [TILE], [i]); wi = pl.slice(w, [TILE], [i])
            mi = pl.add(pl.mul(pl.slice(m, [TILE], [i]), beta1), pl.mul(gi, 1 - beta1))
            vi = pl.add(pl.mul(pl.slice(v, [TILE], [i]), beta2), pl.mul(pl.mul(gi, gi), 1 - beta2))
            mhat = pl.mul(mi, bc1)                       # bc1 = 1/(1-beta1**t)
            vhat = pl.mul(vi, bc2)                       # bc2 = 1/(1-beta2**t)
            upd  = pl.add(pl.div(mhat, pl.add(pl.sqrt(vhat), eps)), pl.mul(wi, wd))
            m = pl.assemble(m, mi, [i])                  # write back persistent state
            v = pl.assemble(v, vi, [i])
            w = pl.assemble(w, pl.sub(wi, pl.mul(upd, lr)), [i])   # in-place param update
```

Notes:

- It runs **after** `backward()` has fully retired, so the activation arena (transient + SAVED) is empty — the optimizer competes for memory only with itself (tiny transients) and the persistent region.
- Writes are **in-place** into persistent buffers; no ring allocation for `w`/`m`/`v`.
- It is submitted on the same orchestrator thread and scheduled by the same machinery; nothing special.

## 28. `zero_grad`, the Accumulation Window, and the Step Loop

```python
opt = pl.AdamW(params, lr=3e-4, betas=(0.9, 0.95), eps=1e-8, weight_decay=0.1)

for step in range(num_steps):
    opt.zero_grad()                       # zero persistent w.grad buffers (§25.2)
    for micro in range(accum_steps):      # gradient-accumulation window
        loss = model(batch[step][micro])  # forward: tape (§8) + SAVED push (§13)
        loss.backward()                   # backward: pop SAVED, atomic_add into grads (§24,§25)
    opt.step()                            # persistent AdamW update (§27); arena empty here
```

Region behavior across the loop:

- **`zero_grad`** touches only the persistent grad buffers. Activation arena untouched.
- **Each micro-batch** pushes its own SAVED stack in forward and **fully pops it** in backward — so the SAVED peak is *per micro-batch*, not per window. Parameter grads (persistent) accumulate across micro-batches via `atomic_add`; activation grads (transient) are born and die within each micro-batch.
- **`opt.step`** runs once per window, when both transient and SAVED are empty.

This is the standard accumulation pattern, and it falls out of the region design without special handling: **persistent grads survive the window; everything in the arena resets every micro-batch.**

## 29. Memory Budget Across Regions (full training step)

```
device memory
├─ Persistent region        ≈ 4× params  (param + grad + Adam m,v)        ── constant across steps
└─ Activation arena (Part 2, double-ended)
   ├─ SAVED stack            ≈ Σ_layers saved-per-layer  (per micro-batch) ── peak at fwd→bwd boundary
   └─ Transient ring-stack   ≈ one layer's working set (fwd) | one bwd node (bwd)
```

Peak ≈ `4×params + peak_SAVED + peak_transient`. The two activation terms trade through the double-ended arena (Part 2 §15); the persistent term is fixed. Checkpointing (Part 2 §18) reduces `peak_SAVED` at the cost of transient + recompute. Gradient accumulation reduces neither activation term (per-micro-batch) but lets a larger effective batch fit by serializing micro-batches.

## 30. Concurrency and Overlap (single-stream base case)

- In the single-stream schedule, backward cannot start until the loss exists (needs all forward), and the optimizer cannot start until backward retires. The three phases are **sequential at the macro level**, fully **parallel within each phase** (the scheduler dispatches independent InCore tasks across workers exactly as in inference).
- One safe overlap available now: **`opt.step` for early-finishing parameters** can begin as soon as their `w.grad` is complete and the window is done — but in single stream this is minor.
- Larger overlaps — backward compute with gradient **all-reduce**, optimizer with next-step forward, 1F1B pipeline (which makes `TRANSIENT_FWD`/`TRANSIENT_BWD` coexist, Part 2 §16.1) — are **distributed-training** concerns deferred to Part 4.

## 31. Worked End-to-End Step (one flash-attention transformer layer)

Using the `FlashAttention` differentiable function from §10.2 inside a layer with a `Linear` (§10.1) projection:

```
zero_grad:   w_qkv.grad ← 0, w_o.grad ← 0           (persistent)
forward:     x → qkv = Linear(x, w_qkv)             tape+SAVED: save x; push
                 o   = FlashAttention(q,k,v,...)     tape+SAVED: save q,k,v,o,lse; push
                 y   = Linear(o, w_o)                tape+SAVED: save o; push
                 loss = mse(y, target)               tape
backward():  seed dloss=1
             ← mse.bwd          → dy                 (transient)
             ← Linear(o,w_o).bwd → do, atomic_add(w_o.grad,·)   pop SAVED(o)
             ← FlashAttn.bwd    → dq,dk,dv  (kv-outer loop, atomic_add dq)  pop SAVED(q,k,v,o,lse)
             ← Linear(x,w_qkv).bwd → dx, atomic_add(w_qkv.grad,·)  pop SAVED(x)
opt.step():  adamw_step(w_qkv, w_qkv.grad, m_qkv, v_qkv, ...)     (persistent, in place)
             adamw_step(w_o,   w_o.grad,   m_o,   v_o,   ...)
```

- Parameter grads (`w_qkv.grad`, `w_o.grad`) accumulate in **persistent** memory; survive to `opt.step`.
- Activation grads (`dy`, `do`, `dq/dk/dv`, `dx`) live in the **transient** region and are reclaimed as consumed.
- SAVED buffers (`x`, `q,k,v,o,lse`, `o`) are **popped LIFO** as each backward node finishes (Part 2 §12).
- `opt.step` runs with the arena empty, updating persistent params in place.

## 32. Summary of Part 3 Decisions

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | How does backward execute? | As **more orchestration**: `backward()` seeds `dL=1`, walks the tape in reverse, **submits** backward bodies; the existing scheduler/tensormap/workers run them. No new hot-path mechanism (§22–§24). |
| 2 | Activation-gradient accumulation? | Sum into a **transient** `t.grad` via `atomic_add`; readiness fan-in count = the forward **fan-out** count; reclaimed by normal ring rules (§25.1). |
| 3 | Parameter-gradient accumulation? | Sum into a **persistent** `w.grad`; accumulates within a pass **and** across micro-batches; zeroed at `zero_grad`, consumed by optimizer (§25.2). |
| 4 | Where do params / grads / optimizer state live? | A **persistent region**, allocated once (≈4× params for AdamW), disjoint from the activation arena (§26). |
| 5 | What is the optimizer step? | A **non-differentiable** orchestration that updates params/state **in place** via ordinary InCore tasks, run when the arena is empty (§27). |
| 6 | Scheduler changes? | **None on the hot path.** New components are TapeManager, SavedStack/arena, PersistentAllocator, gradient-accumulation policy, optimizer library, step driver (§23). |

**Part 4 (below):** distributed training over the Linqu L3–L7 hierarchy.

---

# Part 4 — Distributed Training over the Linqu Hierarchy

Parts 1–3 defined single-stream training: the DSL (differentiable functions, tape), the activation arena (transient + SAVED), the persistent region (params/grads/optimizer), and the step loop. Part 4 scales this across many chips/hosts using the **Linqu hierarchy** (`machine_hierarchy_and_function_hierarchy.md`), the **recursive Worker composition** of `simpler` (L2→L3→L4…, `simpler_distributed_runtime_design.md`), and the **typed `sharded_tensor` collectives** (`sharded_tensor.md`).

The unifying idea of Part 4 — and the reason it needs surprisingly little new machinery:

> **A collective communication operation is itself a differentiable function (Part 1).** Its forward is a `sharded_tensor` collective; its backward is the *conjugate* collective. So distributed training is "single-stream training, plus a handful of collective differentiable functions inserted at parallelism boundaries." Everything from Parts 1–3 (tape, SAVED stack, transient ring, persistent region, gradient accumulation) carries over unchanged.

## 33. Collectives Are Differentiable Functions (Conjugate Backward)

Each collective registers as a differentiable function (§3) over a `sharded_tensor`, with a backward that is its conjugate. This is the distributed analog of §10's `FlashAttention`: forward emits a collective, backward emits the conjugate collective; no special-casing in the tape or scheduler.

| Forward collective | Backward (conjugate) | Used by |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------|
| `all_reduce(SUM)` | `all_reduce(SUM)` (self-conjugate) | TP, DP grad sync |
| `all_gather` | `reduce_scatter(SUM)` | TP/SP, ZeRO param gather |
| `reduce_scatter(SUM)` | `all_gather` | SP, ZeRO grad reduce |
| `all_to_all` | `all_to_all` (transposed split; self-conjugate) | EP dispatch/combine |
| `broadcast(root)` | `reduce(root, SUM)` | param/input broadcast |
| `send(rank)` / `recv(rank)` | `recv(rank)` / `send(rank)` | PP stage boundary |

The Megatron column/row-parallel "f / g" operators fall out of this: the row-parallel linear's forward `all_reduce` has backward `identity`, and the column-parallel split's forward `identity` has backward `all_reduce` — exactly the `all_reduce` self-conjugate row above, applied on the appropriate side.

```python
@pl.autograd_function
class AllReduceSum:                 # one row of the table; the rest are analogous
    @staticmethod
    def forward(ctx, st):           # st : sharded_tensor
        st.all_reduce(op=pl.ReduceOp.SUM)   # typed collective (sharded_tensor.md)
        return st                   # no tensor saved; collectives save only meta (the group)
    @staticmethod
    def backward(ctx, g_st):
        g_st.all_reduce(op=pl.ReduceOp.SUM) # self-conjugate
        return g_st
```

These collective differentiable functions carry **no `SAVED` activations** (only the group/partitioning meta), so they add nothing to the SAVED stack — they only insert backward collective tasks into the tape.

## 34. Mapping Parallelism onto Linqu Levels

Each parallelism scheme is a **rank grid axis** (`rank_shape`, `sharded_tensor.md` §1) bound to a Linqu hierarchy level, and is realized by recursive Worker composition (an L4 orchestrator submits to L3 nodes, which submit to chips, …):

| Scheme | What is split | Dominant collective (fwd/bwd) | Typical Linqu level |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **TP** tensor | weight matrices / heads | `all_reduce` ↔ `all_reduce` | within a chip / tight cluster (L2–L4), highest bandwidth |
| **SP** sequence | sequence dim | `all_gather` ↔ `reduce_scatter` | paired with TP |
| **EP** expert (MoE) | expert set | `all_to_all` ↔ `all_to_all` | L4 (pod) |
| **PP** pipeline | layer stack | `send`/`recv` ↔ `recv`/`send` | across hosts (L3–L5) |
| **DP** data | the mini-batch | grad `all_reduce` (or RS+AG, ZeRO) ↔ identity | outermost (L4–L7), lowest bandwidth tolerated |

Placement principle (from the hierarchy bandwidth model): **put the highest-traffic parallelism on the highest-bandwidth level.** TP (per-layer collectives every forward/backward) belongs inside a chip / tight cluster; DP (one grad sync per step) tolerates the outermost, contracted-bandwidth level. This is purely a `rank_shape`→level mapping; the differentiable-function code is identical regardless of placement.

## 35. Data Parallel: Gradient All-Reduce Overlapped with the Tape Reverse Walk

DP replicates the persistent region (params/grads/optimizer) on each DP rank; after backward, parameter gradients are summed across DP ranks before `opt.step`. The key efficiency point falls out of Part 1 §8.4:

> Because `backward()` walks the tape **in reverse**, parameter gradients **complete layer-by-layer from the output side first**. Each layer's `w.grad` is final as soon as its backward node retires — long before the whole backward finishes. So we can launch its `all_reduce` **immediately** and overlap it with the still-running backward of earlier layers.

This is standard DDP gradient bucketing, and it is *natural* here: the tape reverse order **is** the gradient-ready order. Mechanism:

- Group parameters into **buckets**; when a bucket's grads are all complete (tracked by the same fan-in counting as §25), submit `bucket.all_reduce(SUM)` as a differentiable-function-free collective task at the DP level.
- The collective runs on the runtime's async path (`runtime_async.md`) concurrently with backward compute on the workers; `opt.step` waits only on the last bucket.
- Gradient accumulation (§28): all-reduce is issued **once per window** (after the last micro-batch), not per micro-batch — micro-batch grads accumulate locally first (§25.2), then one sync.

DP changes nothing about the arena; it adds collective tasks on `w.grad` (persistent) between backward and `opt.step`.

## 36. Tensor Parallel: Conjugate Collectives in Forward and Backward

TP shards a layer's weights (and the matching activations) across a TP group as `sharded_tensor`s. The collectives are inserted as differentiable functions (§33), so backward is automatic:

```python
# Megatron-style MLP, one TP group; w1 column-parallel, w2 row-parallel
def tp_mlp(x, w1_shard, w2_shard):
    h  = relu(matmul(x, w1_shard))         # column-parallel: local, no fwd collective
    y  = matmul(h, w2_shard)               # row-parallel: produces partial sums per rank
    y  = AllReduceSum.apply(y)             # fwd all_reduce; bwd is all_reduce (identity-side)
    return y
```

- **Forward** inserts `all_reduce` (row-parallel output). **Backward** inserts the conjugate `all_reduce` on the input-gradient side — emitted automatically by the tape because `AllReduceSum` is a differentiable function. No hand-written backward collective.
- **Memory:** TP shrinks the **persistent region per rank** (each holds `1/tp` of params/grads/optimizer) and shards the large activations, reducing the SAVED stack per rank. This is TP's main memory benefit, expressed entirely through `sharded_tensor` partitioning.
- **Placement:** per-layer `all_reduce` is high-traffic → keep the TP group within a chip / tight cluster (§34).

## 37. Pipeline Parallel: 1F1B and the Multi-Microbatch SAVED Stacks

PP splits the layer stack into stages on different hosts; activations cross stage boundaries via `send`/`recv` differentiable functions (§33, conjugate = `recv`/`send`). The training-relevant consequence is the **activation-memory** interaction flagged in Part 2 §16.1:

- A 1F1B (one-forward-one-backward) schedule keeps **several micro-batches in flight** on each stage, interleaving forward of one with backward of another. So `TRANSIENT_FWD` and `TRANSIENT_BWD` **coexist**, and **multiple SAVED stacks are live simultaneously** — one per in-flight micro-batch.
- Memory model per stage: `SAVED_peak_stage ≈ (#in-flight micro-batches) × (per-micro-batch per-stage SAVED)`. The double-ended arena (Part 2 §15) generalizes by giving **each in-flight micro-batch its own transient sub-arena and its own SAVED stack**, all within the stage's arena; `#in-flight` is bounded by the pipeline depth (deeper stages hold fewer in flight in 1F1B, which is exactly why 1F1B bounds activation memory vs naive all-forward-then-all-backward).
- `send`/`recv` carry activations forward and gradients backward; each is a tape entry, so the cross-stage backward is automatic. The cross-stage activation that a stage must keep for its own backward is an ordinary `SAVED` entry on that stage.

PP is therefore the one scheme that materially changes the arena (multiple concurrent SAVED stacks), and the design already anticipated it in Part 2 §16.1.

## 38. ZeRO / FSDP: Sharding the Persistent Region

Plain DP replicates the full persistent region (≈4× params, §26) on every rank — wasteful at scale. ZeRO/FSDP shards it across the DP group and reconstructs just-in-time:

| ZeRO stage | Sharded across DP | Collective added |
|------------|-------------------|------------------|
| ZeRO-1 | optimizer state (`m,v`) | none extra (grad `all_reduce` → `reduce_scatter`) |
| ZeRO-2 | + gradients | grad `reduce_scatter` (replaces `all_reduce`) |
| ZeRO-3 / FSDP | + parameters | param `all_gather` in fwd & bwd; grad `reduce_scatter` |

In ZeRO-3, a parameter is **not** persistently resident in full: each rank holds `1/dp` of it, and the full shard is `all_gather`-ed **just before** the layer's forward (and again before its backward), then released. So:

- The gathered full parameter behaves like a **transient** buffer (gather → use → free), not a persistent one — it lives briefly in the transient region (or a dedicated gather buffer), bounding resident param memory to `1/dp` + one layer's gathered shard.
- `all_gather` (fwd) and its conjugate `reduce_scatter` (bwd) are the same differentiable-function collectives from §33; gradients are `reduce_scatter`-ed into the rank's `1/dp` grad shard.
- This is the memory/communication tradeoff that lets very large models fit; it is expressed purely as `sharded_tensor` partitioning of the persistent region plus the §33 collectives, with no new runtime concept.

## 39. Expert Parallel (MoE): All-to-All Dispatch / Combine

MoE routes tokens to experts living on different ranks via `all_to_all` (dispatch) and gathers results via `all_to_all` (combine). Both are differentiable functions whose conjugate is `all_to_all` (§33), so the backward dispatch/combine are automatic. The data-dependent routing (which token to which expert) rides on `rank_index`/index tensors as `ctx.meta` (non-differentiable, §5.1), and the gradient `all_to_all` reuses the forward routing recorded in the tape entry.

## 40. Recompute / Checkpointing at Scale

Checkpointing (Part 2 §18) is most valuable under PP, where it directly reduces the multiplied SAVED term (§37): wrapping each stage's layers in `with pl.checkpoint()` cuts `per-micro-batch per-stage SAVED` so that `#in-flight × SAVED` stays within budget. The cost (recompute in backward) overlaps with pipeline bubbles. The policy knob is per-stage and composes with TP/DP/ZeRO without interaction beyond the arena balance already described.

## 41. Runtime Realization

- **Recursive Worker composition (unchanged from `simpler`).** An L_k orchestrator submits to L_{k-1} nodes; collectives are submitted at the level matching their `rank_shape` axis. Backward and optimizer submissions use the same recursive path (Part 3 §22) — distributed backward is "more orchestration" at each level.
- **Roles (§5.7).** Collective-issuing functions are `ORCHESTRATOR`s at their level; compute remains in `WORKER`s. `pl.tree_reduce` (machine-hierarchy doc §5.8) is the building block for hierarchical gradient reductions.
- **Async overlap (`runtime_async.md`).** Gradient all-reduce (§35), ZeRO all-gather (§38), and PP send/recv (§37) run on the async path, overlapping communication with worker compute — the concrete mechanism behind the "overlap" claims above.
- **Hot path still unchanged.** As in Part 3 §23, the scheduler/tensormap/worker core is untouched; Part 4 adds collective differentiable functions, `sharded_tensor`-typed persistent/activation regions, and level placement.

## 42. Worked Example: TP×DP Transformer Layer (one step)

```
rank grid: rank_shape = (dp, tp)   # DP outer (cross-host), TP inner (in-chip)

zero_grad:  shard-local w.grad ← 0
forward (per DP rank, sharded over TP):
    qkv = tp_matmul(x, w_qkv_shard)            # column-parallel, local
    o   = FlashAttention(q,k,v,...)            # heads sharded over TP; SAVED push (per rank)
    y   = AllReduceSum.apply(matmul(o, w_o_shard))   # row-parallel: fwd all_reduce (TP group)
    loss = mse(y, target)
backward():                                    # tape reverse walk
    ... mse.bwd → dy
    AllReduceSum.bwd                            # conjugate all_reduce (TP) — automatic
    FlashAttn.bwd → dq,dk,dv                    # pop SAVED; shard-local
    tp_matmul.bwd → dx, atomic_add(w_*_shard.grad, ·)
    └─ as each bucket of w_*_shard.grad completes (reverse order):
          bucket.reduce_scatter / all_reduce over DP group   # overlap with ongoing bwd (§35)
opt.step():  adamw_step over shard-local (param, grad, m, v)  # ZeRO-1: state sharded over DP
```

- TP collectives (`all_reduce`) run **in-chip** every layer; DP collectives run **cross-host once per window**, overlapped with backward.
- Persistent region per rank ≈ `4×params / tp` (and `/dp` further for ZeRO-sharded state).
- SAVED/transient arena per rank is the Part 2 arena, sized for the TP-sharded activations.

## 43. Memory Budget Under Parallelism (per rank)

```
persistent  ≈ 4×params / tp            (× 1/dp more for ZeRO-1/2/3 on state/grad/param)
SAVED       ≈ (#in-flight microbatch_PP) × Σ_localLayers saved-per-layer / tp
transient   ≈ one (sub-)layer working set / tp     (× #in-flight under PP)
+ gather buf ≈ one layer's all-gathered param      (ZeRO-3 only)
```

Each parallelism axis divides a different term: **TP** divides params + activations, **DP/ZeRO** divides the persistent region, **PP** multiplies SAVED by in-flight count (mitigated by checkpointing). Choosing the parallelism mix is choosing how to drive each term under the device-memory and bandwidth-per-level constraints.

## 44. Summary of Part 4 Decisions

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|----------|----------|
| 1 | How do collectives fit autograd? | Each collective is a **differentiable function** whose backward is its **conjugate** collective (§33). Backward collectives are emitted by the tape automatically — no special cases. |
| 2 | How is parallelism expressed? | As `sharded_tensor` **`rank_shape` axes** bound to **Linqu levels**, realized by recursive Worker composition; highest-traffic scheme on highest-bandwidth level (§34). |
| 3 | DP gradient sync efficiency? | **Bucketed all-reduce overlapped with the tape reverse walk** — reverse order *is* gradient-ready order; one sync per accumulation window (§35). |
| 4 | TP forward/backward collectives? | Conjugate collectives inserted as differentiable functions; persistent region & activations shard `1/tp` per rank (§36). |
| 5 | PP activation memory? | `#in-flight × per-stage SAVED`; the double-ended arena gives each in-flight micro-batch its own SAVED stack + transient sub-arena (Part 2 §16.1, §37). |
| 6 | Very large models (ZeRO/FSDP)? | Shard the **persistent region** over DP; **just-in-time `all_gather`** params (transient), **`reduce_scatter`** grads — all via §33 collectives (§38). |
| 7 | New runtime mechanism? | **None on the hot path.** Reuses recursive Workers, roles, `tree_reduce`, async overlap, and `sharded_tensor` collectives (§41). |

---

## 45. Series Conclusion

Across the four parts, the design adds training to PyPTO **without changing the inference hot path**:

- **Part 1 (DSL):** differentiate at the **differentiable-function** level (not InCore); `ctx.save_for_backward` is the lifetime hook; a thin **tape** builds the backward graph; backward/forward InCore are **not 1:1**.
- **Part 2 (memory):** **three lifetime classes**, **two activation regions** (transient ring-stack shared by fwd/bwd + a LIFO **SAVED stack**) in a **double-ended arena**, plus a persistent region — saved context is allocated in place, not copied or pinned.
- **Part 3 (runtime):** backward and optimizer are **"more orchestration"** on the unchanged scheduler; two kinds of gradient accumulation (transient activation grads vs persistent parameter grads); the persistent region holds params/grads/optimizer state.
- **Part 4 (distributed):** **collectives are differentiable functions** with conjugate backward, placed by `rank_shape`→Linqu-level mapping; DP/TP/PP/EP/ZeRO are compositions of these collectives over the existing recursive runtime.

The recurring theme: **everything new lives at the differentiable-function / orchestration layer and in the memory-region bookkeeping; the InCore execution core, the tensormap fan-in/fan-out scheduler, and the worker model are reused unchanged from inference.**

# Appendix A — End-to-End Worked Example: a Llama-style Transformer Block

This appendix ties Parts 1–3 together on a realistic **multi-operator** program: one pre-norm decoder block as used in Llama (RMSNorm → attention+RoPE → residual → RMSNorm → SwiGLU MLP → residual). It shows the **forward program**, the **forward graph**, the **tape** recorded during forward, the **backward graph**, and the **backward execution** with the SAVED-stack timeline. (Distributed sharding from Part 4 is omitted here for clarity; it would insert the §33 collective differentiable functions at TP/SP boundaries without changing the structure below.)

## A.1 The building-block differentiable functions

Each op below is a differentiable function (§3); composite ops (the block itself) need no hand-written backward — the tape reverses them (§6.1). For the leaves, the table lists what `save_for_backward` keeps (§5) and the backward formula.

| Diff. function | Forward | `save_for_backward` | Backward (sketch) |
|----------------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| `RMSNorm(x,w)` | `x * rstd * w`, `rstd=1/√(mean(x²)+ε)` | `x, w, rstd` (rstd is `[rows,1]`) | `dx` from `dy,w,rstd,x`; `dw=Σ dy*x*rstd` |
| `Linear(x,w)` | `x @ w` (§10.1) | `x, w` | `dx=dy@wᵀ`, `dw=xᵀ@dy` |
| `RoPE(t,cos,sin)` | rotate-half pos-encode | `cos, sin` (meta: positions) | apply inverse rotation to `dt` |
| `FlashAttention(q,k,v)` | online softmax (§10.2) | `q,k,v,o,lse` (lse `[S,1]`) | kv-outer recompute (§10.2) |
| `SwiGLU(g,u)` | `silu(g) * u` | `g, u` | `du=silu(g)*ds`; `dg=ds*u*silu'(g)` |
| `Add(a,b)` | `a + b` (residual) | *nothing* | `da=dgrad`, `db=dgrad` (passthrough) |

Note `Add` saves nothing and passes gradient to **both** inputs — this is what makes the residual a gradient **fan-out → accumulation** point (§25.1) and a **non-strict-LIFO** SAVED case (§12.1).

## A.2 The forward program

```python
@pl.function(type=pl.FunctionType.Opaque, differentiable=True)
def llama_block(self, x, w):          # w = bag of this block's parameters
    # ---- attention sub-block (pre-norm) ----
    h1 = RMSNorm.apply(x, w.norm1)                 # n1
    q  = Linear.apply(h1, w.wq)                    # lq
    k  = Linear.apply(h1, w.wk)                    # lk
    v  = Linear.apply(h1, w.wv)                    # lv
    q  = RoPE.apply(q, w.cos, w.sin)               # rq
    k  = RoPE.apply(k, w.cos, w.sin)               # rk
    a  = FlashAttention.apply(q, k, v, w.scale, True)   # fa  (causal)
    a  = Linear.apply(a, w.wo)                     # lo
    x1 = Add.apply(x, a)                           # r1  (residual 1)
    # ---- MLP sub-block (SwiGLU, pre-norm) ----
    h2 = RMSNorm.apply(x1, w.norm2)                # n2
    g  = Linear.apply(h2, w.w_gate)                # lg
    u  = Linear.apply(h2, w.w_up)                  # lu
    s  = SwiGLU.apply(g, u)                        # sg
    m  = Linear.apply(s, w.w_down)                 # ld
    x2 = Add.apply(x1, m)                          # r2  (residual 2)
    return x2
```

Fifteen differentiable-function invocations (labels `n1, lq, …, r2`). Each `.apply` appends **one** tape entry (§8.3) — *not* one per InCore kernel: when the compiler outlines, e.g., `FlashAttention` into many InCore tiles, the tape still holds a single `fa` node (§7, §8.2).

## A.3 Forward graph (data-flow DAG)

Edges are tensors; nodes are differentiable-function invocations. Note the two **fan-out** points that residual/multi-use create (marked ◀): `x` (used by `n1` and `r1`), `h1` (used by `lq,lk,lv`), `x1` (used by `n2` and `r2`), `h2` (used by `lg,lu`).

## A.4 The tape recorded during forward

Append-only, in submission order (§8.3). `saved_ctx` entries are pushed onto the SAVED stack as they are produced (§13); `meta` costs no buffer.

| # | node | diff. fn | `saved_ctx` (→ SAVED stack push) | consumes grad of | produces grad of |
|---|------|----------|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1 | n1 | RMSNorm | `x, w.norm1, rstd1` | h1 | x, w.norm1 |
| 2 | lq | Linear | `h1, w.wq` | q | h1, w.wq |
| 3 | lk | Linear | `h1, w.wk` | k | h1, w.wk |
| 4 | lv | Linear | `h1, w.wv` | v | h1, w.wv |
| 5 | rq | RoPE | `cos, sin` (meta) | q' | q |
| 6 | rk | RoPE | `cos, sin` (meta) | k' | k |
| 7 | fa | FlashAttention | `q', k', v, a, lse` | a | q', k', v |
| 8 | lo | Linear | `a, w.wo` | a' | a, w.wo |
| 9 | r1 | Add | *(none)* | x1 | x, a' |
| 10 | n2 | RMSNorm | `x1, w.norm2, rstd2` | h2 | x1, w.norm2 |
| 11 | lg | Linear | `h2, w.w_gate` | g | h2, w.w_gate |
| 12 | lu | Linear | `h2, w.w_up` | u | h2, w.w_up |
| 13 | sg | SwiGLU | `g, u` | s | g, u |
| 14 | ld | Linear | `s, w.w_down` | m | s, w.w_down |
| 15 | r2 | Add | *(none)* | x2 | x1, m |

The block is **composite** (§6.1): no backward was written for `llama_block` itself; the 15 entries above are sufficient to reverse it.

## A.5 Backward graph (gradient-flow DAG)

`loss.backward()` seeds `dx2` and walks the tape **15→1** (§24). Gradients flow opposite the forward edges. At each forward fan-out, backward has a **`Σ` accumulation** node (§25.1) whose fan-in count equals the forward fan-out count (§8.5). Accumulation points are marked ⊕.

```

Parameter-gradient leaves (`dw.norm1, dw.wq, …, dw.w_down`) drop out of each `Linear.bwd`/`RMSNorm.bwd`/`SwiGLU` node via `atomic_add` into the **persistent** grad buffers (§25.2); they are not shown as edges to keep the activation-gradient flow legible.

Key structural facts visible in the graph:
- **Three `⊕` accumulation nodes** at `dh2` (fan-in 2), `dx1` (fan-in 2), `dh1` (fan-in 3), plus `dx` at the block input (fan-in 2 from the two residual paths). Each fan-in count is exactly the forward fan-out (§8.5).
- The **residual skip edges** (`r1`/`r2` passing gradient straight back) are why `dx1` and `dx` accumulate across non-adjacent tape positions — the **non-strict-LIFO** SAVED case (§12.1): `Add` saved nothing, so no SAVED entry, but the *graph* shows a gradient arriving "out of stack order."

## A.6 Backward execution + SAVED-stack timeline

The SAVED stack (Part 2 §12) is pushed in forward (#1→#15 producing order) and popped as each backward node consumes its `saved_ctx`. Because `Add` saves nothing, the stack holds 13 entries at the fwd→bwd boundary; popping is LIFO except where a value is still needed (none here cross the boundary irregularly, since residual grads need no SAVED — they passthrough).

```
forward push order (bottom→top of SAVED stack):
   [x,norm1,rstd1] [h1,wq] [h1,wk] [h1,wv] [cos,sin]meta [cos,sin]meta
   [q',k',v,a,lse] [a,wo]  ──(r1: none)──  [x1,norm2,rstd2] [h2,wgate]
   [h2,wup] [g,u] [s,wdown]  ──(r2: none)──            ◀ TOP, SAVED at peak

backward (reverse walk) — pop as consumed:
   r2.bwd : (no SAVED)            dx1_a, dm
   ld.bwd : pop [s,wdown]         ds          + atomic_add(w_down.grad)
   sg.bwd : pop [g,u]             dg, du
   lu.bwd : pop [h2,wup]          dh2 += ...  + atomic_add(w_up.grad)
   lg.bwd : pop [h2,wgate]        dh2  ⊕      + atomic_add(w_gate.grad)
   n2.bwd : pop [x1,norm2,rstd2]  dx1_b       + atomic_add(norm2.grad)
   (accumulate dx1 = dx1_a ⊕ dx1_b)                          ── transient grad, §25.1
   r1.bwd : (no SAVED)            dx_a, da'
   lo.bwd : pop [a,wo]            da          + atomic_add(wo.grad)
   fa.bwd : pop [q',k',v,a,lse]   dq',dk',dv  (recompute p; kv-outer; §10.2)
   rk.bwd : pop [cos,sin]meta     dk
   rq.bwd : pop [cos,sin]meta     dq
   lv.bwd : pop [h1,wv]           dh1 += ...  + atomic_add(wv.grad)
   lk.bwd : pop [h1,wk]           dh1  ⊕      + atomic_add(wk.grad)
   lq.bwd : pop [h1,wq]           dh1  ⊕      + atomic_add(wq.grad)
   (accumulate dh1 = lq ⊕ lk ⊕ lv)
   n1.bwd : pop [x,norm1,rstd1]   dx_b        + atomic_add(norm1.grad)
   (accumulate dx = dx_a ⊕ dx_b)   ← block input gradient returned to previous block
```

Observations tying back to the design:
1. **One tape entry per logical op, many InCore kernels each (§7, §8.2).** `fa.bwd` alone outlines into a different count/shape of InCore kernels than `fa` forward — the tape and the graphs above are at the differentiable-function level; the InCore tensormap underneath is far larger.
2. **SAVED is LIFO with a tiny non-LIFO relaxation (§12).** Pops follow reverse push order; residual gradients need no SAVED entry, so the only "out of order" effect is gradient *accumulation* timing (`dx1`, `dx`), handled by ref-count, not stack order.
3. **Two accumulation regimes coexist (§25).** Activation grads (`dh1, dh2, dx1, dx`) accumulate in the **transient** region via fan-in = forward fan-out; parameter grads (`*.grad`) accumulate in the **persistent** region via `atomic_add`, surviving to `opt.step`.
4. **`flash` is the memory hotspot.** Its `saved_ctx = {q',k',v,a,lse}` dominates this block's SAVED footprint; `lse` being `[S,1]` rather than `[S,S]` (§5.3) is the single biggest activation-memory saving in the block.
5. **Stacking blocks.** A full model is `llama_block` repeated `L` times; the tape is the concatenation of `L` such 15-entry segments, the SAVED stack grows to ≈ `L × (per-block saved)` at the fwd→bwd boundary (the dominant training-memory term, §19, §29), and `backward()` reverses all `15L` entries — with DP grad all-reduce (§35) overlapping as each block's parameter grads complete in reverse order.
